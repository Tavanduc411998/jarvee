This Twitter hack was built to help you have a better understanding of what works well for your followers and what doesn\u2019t. This will help you recognize what\u2019s actually gathering you impressive traffic and re-evaluate things that aren\u2019t hitting their mark.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter is all about focused relationship management. Followers expect to be heard and it\u2019d be a good thing to start using this Twitter hack to build a better relationship with them through honest and timely replies. Know what your followers want, evaluate what they are sharing; request or complaint? Check if their tweets about your brand are going in the direction that you want them to.<br \/>\nBeing as it may that this is, in fact, social media, it is critical that you handle any type of issue before it bombshells.<\/p>\n<p>Take the information you gathered from the analytics to prioritize instances where you need to respond, tackle issues personally and help internal situations before they escalate if required. Don\u2019t be so scripted about this, remember that your followers do not prefer robotic responses, and they shouldn\u2019t have to encounter them.<\/p>\n<p>Think about creating two Twitter accounts, one can focus on things like marketing and those positive engagements and the latter can be for problems that may occur and dealing with irate followers. Be clear and transparent with your responses and with your audience. Don\u2019t just keep them waiting, if you\u2019re having a rough time handling things, give them a heads up and let them know how long they might have to wait.<\/p>\n<p>Take note that your audience has their own set of business and working hours. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to go and be a push-over just to satisfy your followers or your team. Make sure to also show a sense of authority with each, and take the time to educate them on social approach and service, empower them.<\/p>\n<p>With the help of these little Twitter hacks, you\u2019re sure to get things rolling quickly. Take time to consider being proactive. Why?

Never forget about transparency, because customers enjoy knowing they can trust the person at the other end.<\/p>\n<h3>Wrapping it Up<\/h3>\n<p>It is important to never forget that you are creating marketing plans for long-term branding, which should be reviewed and updated at least annually. Just going after numbers and stories is not a full proof business plan. Take your time to select the most important topics related to your brand that will help you create quality content for your quality followers on Twitter.
