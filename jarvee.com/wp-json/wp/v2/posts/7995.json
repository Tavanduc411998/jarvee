The reason is that if you want to survive in the competitive digital market, you should not lack anything that your rivals possess. <\/p>\n<p>Mobile apps are just another way to connect to your audience while facilitating the purchase process for them. The value of your app should be clear to your audience because they should find it worthwhile enough to let it occupy some space on their smartphones. When you ensure people that they will have a more convenient and simple journey through your mobile app, it is highly probable that they download your app. You can convince them on your Facebook &#038; Instagram ads by showing them the advantages of your app.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Increase Mobile App Downloads From Your Facebook &#038; Instagram Ads?<\/h2>\n<p>You can increase the number of your mobile app downloads from your Facebook and Instagram ads. Here are several tips that tell you how you can do it perfectly:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/increase-mobile-app-downloads.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"936\" height=\"468\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8048\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/increase-mobile-app-downloads.png 936w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/increase-mobile-app-downloads-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/increase-mobile-app-downloads-768x384.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/increase-mobile-app-downloads-600x300.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>#1 Prioritize Your Existing Customers<\/h3>\n<p>Unlike game apps, your business does not solely work with mobile apps. The aim of your mobile app is to either offer additional advantages to your audience or make their journey more convenient. In fact, your aims and targets totally depend on you and the functionality of your business. <\/p>\n<p>In this case, your target users are your existing customers in the first place. Make a list of the customers who have bought from you in the past few months. Then, use the custom audience on your ad to show your mobile app ads to the audience inside your list. Depending on the type of your business, you can change the custom of your ad audience. <\/p>\n<p>In addition, you can also choose a new target audience and target those customers who have not bought from you since long ago. Perhaps they have stopped buying from you and found other counterparts similar to you because you did not have a mobile app to facilitate their access to you. Therefore, when they come to the realization that you have created a mobile app, it is highly likely that they come back to you. <\/p>\n<h3>#2 Target Lookalike Audiences<\/h3>\n<p>Lookalike audiences are those cold audiences who have once visited your website and did not come back again or those who did not spend much time during their visit from your website. It is also probable that they have not ever heard about you. In any case, lookalike audiences have a high capacity to convert as you have already converted your current customers with the same characteristics.  <\/p>\n<p>As lookalike customers have the same demographics as your custom customers, it is smart to focus on them to download your app as well. But how to recognize a lookalike audience and attract them? The answer is simple. You can track your website visitors and put them into different categories. <\/p>\n<h3>#3 Segment Your Audience Based on their Devices<\/h3>\n<p>Audience segmentation is useful in a way that helps you show the proper app store landing page to your audience regarding the mobile device they use. Therefore, when setting up your Facebook &#038; Instagram ads, you can go to the \u2018Detailed Targeting\u2019 section and choose \u2018Behaviors\u2019. There, you can click or tap on \u2018Digital Activities\u2019 where you can view \u2018All Mobile Devices by Brand\u2019 and show your ad to the relevant users.<\/p>\n<h3>#4 Add Images and Videos of Your App<\/h3>\n<p>There might be several mobile apps just like yours. There must be something valuable about your mobile app that distinguishes it from others. Something that convinces them to prefer you over all the other mobile apps. <\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, both Facebook and <a href=\"https:\/\/socialmarketingwriting.com\/instagram-story-ad-examples-templates\/\">Instagram ads<\/a> have the option of being visual. Therefore, you can accompany your ad with practical images and videos. However, to get the viewers to download your app, these images and videos should be highly captivating and quite remarkable in comparison to the similar apps currently in use. <\/p>\n<p>Try to introduce the steps in your app using images and videos. Show how your app works and show off the interface and design of your app. Ensure the target audience of the efficient functioning of your app through visual content. <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/mobile-apps.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"567\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8051\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/mobile-apps.jpg 850w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/mobile-apps-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/mobile-apps-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/mobile-apps-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>#5 Use Proper CTA Buttons\/Phrases<\/h3>\n<p>Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons are a significant part of your Facebook &#038; Instagram ads. They determine whether your audience will take the final step toward downloading your app or not. In other words, the right CTA buttons or phrases can change the destiny of your ad. Facebook &#038; Instagram ads offer you several CTA phrases for your CTA button. You can test different ones to see which one works better for your ad. <\/p>\n<h3>#6 Choose Mobile Placements<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/407108559393196\">Placements<\/a> are the places where you choose as the right channels for your ads to be seen. You can run your ad on Facebook, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, and Audience Network. If you choose the \u2018Automatic Placement\u2019 offered by Facebook &#038; Instagram ads in the Ads Manager, you can get the most out of your budget. <\/p>\n<p>When it comes to the mobile application download, you should of course consider mobile-first placements for running your ad. When you are looking for mobile users to use your mobile app on their smartphones, it is not a smart choice to run your ad on desktop channels. <\/p>\n<p>The pricing of the placements differs to some extent. For instance, Instagram is the most expensive one per action among others. But it does not actually mean that you should avoid Instagram for your running ads. The reason is that there are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/253577\/number-of-monthly-active-instagram-users\/#:~:text=In%20June%202018%2C%20Instagram%20had,user%20properties%20owned%20by%20Facebook.\">1 billion active users on Instagram<\/a> which signifies that there is a great engagement that compensates for your investment. As a result, you can run your ad on Instagram and <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-to-turn-social-engagement-into-first-time-buyers-social-commerce\/\">turn the engagement into first-time customers<\/a>.  <\/p>\n<p>In addition, as for the high engagement on Instagram, you may already have an account with high engagement on Instagram. Therefore, there may be some audience who already know or have already heard about you. In this case, if they see your ad, there is a higher chance that they download your app. If you do not have an Instagram account yet, or if it does not have a large follower base, you can use an Instagram management service to control all the matters with your Instagram account.<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>Businesses may decide to create a mobile app for various reasons. Whatever the reason, the aim is to attract more customers to your <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/7-low-cost-ways-to-increase-sales-for-your-business\/\">business and increase sales<\/a>. Therefore, it is necessary to find a relevant audience to download your mobile app through which they can convert easily. The tips above have just demonstrated how you can increase the number of your mobile app download through Facebook &#038; Instagram ads. <\/p>\n<p>Stick to these tips and grow your mobile app download times.
