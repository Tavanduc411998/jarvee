					<description><![CDATA[I really like the part of the competitors. We really don&#039;t need to make some superhumans efforts to get to our goals. Just look at what smart people already do, copy the best of it, add some personal charm, and voila, results will come.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Definitely it&#039;s a good suggestion to make sure to post what your audience likes, not what you think they will like. But in order to understand this, you have to do some testing, try different type of content, branding, colors, etc and see on what type of content you will get the best engagement.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Social media industry is like any other industry in terms of competitors. You always have to keep an eye on your competitors and be aware of what they are doing. I don&#039;t support coping ideas from others, but this can help you to build your own idea that you can use for your brand.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The main thing is to be ready for the change. The only thing constant is change. We must plan, i agree, we must be focused and we must eliminate things that are slowing us down, but, at the same time, we must adopt our self to the idea that today&#039;s plans and products could be worthless tomorrow. We must brave to make cuts today,now and to make another plans on a daily, or almost on a hourly basis.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Planning strategy is a must, but still you can&#039;t be too strict with the plan now when things change on a daily basis. Days when you have complete content  plan planned for a month in advance are gone. You need to be ready to add or remove content when needed.]]></description>
