					<description><![CDATA[I use hashtags on FB, TW, P &#038; IG. People are more attuned to using hashtags on TW and IG. With FB and P, it&#039;s never really taken off BUT there are some who are savvy and I use them there just in case. I tend to use a lot of tags on IG because that&#039;s how it&#039;s build. I used as many as I can on Twitter. On Facebook, I&#039;m using no more than 10 and on Pinterest, the same, although I tend to consciously max at 5. It&#039;s a matter of finding which hashtags to use and how hot they are and relevancy. It&#039;s a dance, for sure]]></description>
