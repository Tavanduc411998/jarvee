If you\u2019ve been struggling to find the right creative for your Facebook ad campaigns, this article will help ease your worries.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re looking to generate more conversions or improve your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialmediaexaminer.com\/10-facebook-ad-metrics-marketers-must-track\/\">Facebook ad metrics<\/a>, here are 5 ways you can improve your Facebook ads.<\/p>\n<h3>Display your products using carousel ads<\/h3>\n<p>If you want your products to tell their own story, a carousel ad can be the best way to go. This type of ad creative features 2 to 10 images or videos where users swipe through multiple products showing a unique headline, call-to-action, and link to a specific landing page for each of your products. This ad creative is available for most forms of ad objectives &#8211; its only limitations are that it\u2019s not available for the engagement objective and the video views objective is limited to the Instagram stories placement.<\/p>\n<p>If you need help creating the perfect carousel ad, here\u2019s a step-by-step guide from Facebook on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/1375829326076396?id=563305920700338&amp;helpref=faq_content\">how to create carousel ads<\/a> &#8211; and their own page showing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/carouselformat?fref=ts\">creative examples of carousel ads.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Placement specific ads<\/h3>\n<p>If you don\u2019t make specific changes to a Facebook ad, Facebook will automatically show your ads on the following platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Audience Network, and Messenger. When you do this, chances are, you\u2019re not maximizing the visibility of your ads to reach a warm audience.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1010894\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Placement-specific-ads.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"470\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Placement-specific-ads.png 615w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Placement-specific-ads-300x282.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Placement-specific-ads-600x564.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here are different ways you can customize the placement of your ads:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stories<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When used correctly, this ad placement can be very beneficial for your business &#8211; especially now that the <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/bite-size-marketing-social-media-marketing-strategies-that-cater-to-your-audiences-short-attention-span\/\">average attention span<\/a> has dropped to 8 seconds. Story-only ads are short videos in a full-screen view that will deliver your message right away. In Facebook story ads, the ad objective is limited to video views, lead generation, reach, conversions, app installs, brand awareness, and traffic.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Messenger<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A Messenger-only ad is another placement-specific ad that offers a personalized experience to your target market. It is divided into three: Sponsored message, Messenger inbox, or click to Messenger ad.<\/p>\n<p>A sponsored message is an ad that sends messages to people you\u2019ve talked to on Messenger in the past.<\/p>\n<p>A Messenger inbox ad is an ad found in between your messages on Messenger. Once your audience clicks this ad, it will open up a detailed view of your ad that will lead them closer to your chosen landing page.<\/p>\n<p>A click to Messenger ad is an ad that appears on all your chosen placements that adds a send message button as the preferred call-to-action. Once your audience clicks this ad, it will open a new conversation beginning with an automated greeting and a list of frequently asked questions you created.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Test each of the platforms individually<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Did you know that over 4.48 billion people have more than one social media account?<\/p>\n<p>Not everyone may be as active on Facebook as they are on Instagram and vice-versa. Finding the right platform where your audience is most active can take some time to test; it can be exclusive on Instagram, Facebook, news feed, stories, Messenger, search results, or in-stream videos &#8211; but once you do figure out the right placements, you\u2019ll give yourself the best chance to gain visibility with your target market and maximize ad budget.<\/p>\n<h3>Ditch stock photos<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s a big problem when it comes to using professional, stock photos for your Facebook ads &#8211; your audience has probably seen them before. If you want to capture the attention of your audience through photos, here\u2019s what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/ads\/photo-ad-format\">Facebook recommends<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Show faces of people using your product<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t crowd your image with ugly blocks of text<\/li>\n<li>Use high-resolution images<\/li>\n<li>Test different color schemes<\/li>\n<li>Maintain visual consistency<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Host a giveaway<\/h3>\n<p>Who doesn\u2019t love a freebie? One of the best ways to increase brand awareness, reach, and engagement is through a giveaway. This type of ad can be useful to promote a new product, get rid of old stock, and collect contact details.<\/p>\n<p>Offering a giveaway also shows that you have confidence in the products you\u2019re offering as you let people try your products in exchange for a share, comment, or email address.<\/p>\n<p>When hosting a giveaway, however, make sure to clearly outline the rules of your giveaway to not mislead your audience and to abide by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/policies\/pages_groups_events\/\">Facebook\u2019s policies<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1010891\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Collaborate-with-influencers.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"472\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Collaborate-with-influencers.png 596w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Collaborate-with-influencers-300x283.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Collaborate with influencers<\/h3>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, showing the faces of people using your products can give you a better chance of increasing your reach, brand awareness, and engagement. The only difference is, this time, you\u2019re using a familiar face to help influence the decision of your target audience; plus, you get to reach a new audience consisting of your influencer\u2019s followers.<\/p>\n<p>Having influencers promote your products will also build trust and credibility for your brand. Just make sure the influencer\/s you choose are relevant to your niche.<\/p>\n<h3>Don\u2019t forget the data<\/h3>\n<p>As you experiment using some of the different ways you can improve your Facebook ad creatives mentioned above, make sure you\u2019re monitoring relevant data.<\/p>\n<p>Aside from the CTR, CPC, and return on ad spend (ROAS) data, you\u2019ll also want to add the following often overlooked metrics when monitoring the success of your Facebook ads. To do this, go to Facebook ads manager, click on the \u2018Columns: Performance\u2019 column on the upper right side. Next, click on \u2018customize columns\u2019 to change the current dashboard and search for the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Frequency<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is the number<\/p>\n<p>of times your ads were shown to the same person. Facebook suggests keeping your ad frequency <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/1546570362238584\">between 1 to 2<\/a>, depending on your budget and duration. When the performance of your ad begins to drop as the frequency rises, this should be a good indicator of changing up your ad creative or target audience.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Desired action<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Remember what your goal is for every Facebook ad campaign. Have you achieved the number of likes, landing page views, video views, app installs, etc that you initially aimed for?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Impressions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is the number of times your ad was shown on screen. Knowing the number of impressions your ad was able to generate can indirectly increase brand awareness even if it is not your desired action.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1010892\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Dont-forget-the-data.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"403\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Dont-forget-the-data.png 719w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Dont-forget-the-data-300x242.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Dont-forget-the-data-600x483.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>If your Facebook ads have not been up to par with what you\u2019ve expected, take it easy.
