Others paint an unflattering picture of the \u201cMe\u201d Generation, often as someone who is lazy and unable to hold a regular 9 to 5 job for a long time.<\/p>\n<p>Millennials are often described as narcissistic, materialistic, coddled and have somewhat distorted views about life, politics and values. They are indifferent to helping out the community compared to Generation X.<\/p>\n<p>Being born when technology is at its peak of development, they are also the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.generationy.com\/about-generation-y-in-the-workforce\/characteristics\/\">most technical savvy<\/a> among all generations. They live and breathe the internet. Everything they do is intertwined with their smartphones and laptops &#8211; may it be in sending emails, doing online banking, booking hotel reservations, keeping in touch with friends from all over the world and even purchasing goods and services.<\/p>\n<p>Social media has a profound influence on the lives of millennials. To many of them, checking their various social media platforms is as natural as drinking their nth cup of coffee or brushing their teeth. Snapchat is one of the newer social platforms that\u2019s creating quite a commotion with the younger generation. Businesses are always finding ways on how they can appeal to people and get them to do business with them.<\/p>\n<h3>These are the 5 ways to reach Millennials with Snapchat<\/h3>\n<h3>#1 Snapchat is great when it comes to teasers<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/smallbiztrends.com\/2016\/04\/market-to-millennials-with-snapchat.html\">Teasers<\/a> are quick previews of what your product or business is all about. Being on the internet all the time, teasers are great selling points to entice millennials to take notice of your products and eventually purchase them.<\/p>\n<p>When used cleverly, the 10 second allowable time to send your snaps will whet the appetite or interest of the millennials enough for them to have clamor for your business. \u00a0You can even attract millennials to interact with your business by asking them to send snaps in relation to your teasers.<\/p>\n<h3>#2 Snapchat is great when it comes to introducing promotions, contests, and giveaways<\/h3>\n<p>Another great attraction that you can use to promote your business is to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.socialmediaexaminer.com\/5-ways-to-use-snapchat-for-business\/\">introduce promotions, contests and giveaways via Snapchat<\/a>. No one would say no to a freebie, right? So why not use Snapchat to get millennials to take advantage of your giveaways?<\/p>\n<p>In the same manner, you can introduce promotions and contests via Snaps. To build the hype with your audience, you can send a snap of a portion of the promotion you are going to have or rule of your contest on a daily basis. That way, millennials would surely wait for you to release a snap every single day so they will know all the details of your promotion or contest and take part of it.<\/p>\n<h3>#3 Snapchat is all about story telling<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/snapchat-storytelling.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"589\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3697\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/snapchat-storytelling.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/snapchat-storytelling-300x221.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/snapchat-storytelling-768x565.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/snapchat-storytelling-600x442.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Another distinctive characteristic of millennials is that they are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.imediaconnection.com\/article\/198241\/snapchat-for-business-how-to-reach-millennials-through-storytelling\">fond of good stories<\/a> or storytelling.\u00a0 Snapchat allows you to tell the story about your business via 10 second videos or images that you can post under \u201cMy Story\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Want millennials to notice you or your business? Then send snaps about what your business is all about. You can make segments about your business and send them one at the time. As Snapchat has this 24-hour rule, you are actually forcing your audience to check Snapchat on a daily basis for the latest installment of your story. There is this tantalizing appeal to your followers to try to exert more effort to check your latest snaps because of this time limit.<\/p>\n<h3>#4 Snapchat allows you to connect influencers and your brand<\/h3>\n<p>Influencers can really make or break a product or service. Influencers don&#8217;t necessarily mean that they have to be some hotshot celebrity or popular athlete promoting your brand. Millennials take the word of these influencers seriously.<\/p>\n<p>So if you want to maximize using Snapchat to attract these millennials to patronize your product ASAP then connect with influencers. To date, some of the biggest influencers on social media are not really mainstream celebrities.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/mediakix.com\/2015\/04\/snapchat-celebrities-the-new-social-influencers\/\">Jerome Jarre<\/a> is an internet sensation who became famous for his comical videos on Vine. He made his transition to Snapchat so smooth that one of his videos actually garnered\u00a0 26M views in the 24 hour time span. Another worthy Snapchat influencer you can check out is Jenna Marbles who happens to be one of the earliest online sensations who started gaining audience with her YouTube videos.<\/p>\n<p>By finding the right influencer, you can bring your brand to new heights simply by allowing this person to <a href=\"http:\/\/mediakix.com\/2016\/02\/snapchat-takeover-influencer-strategy\/\">take over<\/a> your brand and promote your products to their rather massive following in their own prespective.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/snapchat-promotions.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3696\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/snapchat-promotions.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/snapchat-promotions-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/snapchat-promotions-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/11\/snapchat-promotions-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Doing a Snapchat Takeover is actually easy.
