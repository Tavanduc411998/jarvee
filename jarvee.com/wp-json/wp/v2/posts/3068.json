It offers brands a great way to increase their visibility and connect with their clients and prospects. If you want to build a strong community of people who relate to your brand and to ensure your products are seen by more people, Instagram is the place to be. <\/p>\n<p>But with over 800 million monthly active users and lots of images uploaded every single day, it can be hard to know how to interact with the Instagram community and get loyal followers who keep coming back for more. But fret not, many users have achieved success, and so can you. Here are some ways you can optimize your Instagram posts and increase engagement.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/high-quality-images.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3111\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/high-quality-images.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/high-quality-images-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/high-quality-images-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/high-quality-images-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Capitalize On High-Quality Photos<\/h3>\n<p>Instagram is image-centric, it is all about visual storytelling. But everybody posts images and videos on Instagram, so how do you ensure you stand out from the rest? Upload images that attract people at first glance; those that lure, captivate and enthrall. <\/p>\n<p>Instagram now allows users to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/7\/6\/8899807\/instagram-1080p-pictures-photo-upload\">upload high-resolution images<\/a> (1080&#215;1080 pixels). While the images are not displayed as such on Instagram, they are saved in 1080px resolution, probably in preparation for making a switch to the bigger size. Upload high-quality images that make people linger on your Instagram posts. As well, add minimal text and relevant hashtags.<\/p>\n<h3>Schedule Your Posts<\/h3>\n<p>If you want to make posting to Instagram easier, start scheduling your posts. While posting in real time has its advantages, it is not ideal for everyone. There are many tools you can use to schedule your posts. Some are computer-only, others are mobile-only, and some work on both mobile and PC. <\/p>\n<p>Some of the most popular scheduling tools help you set up a timer when to go ahead and publish your photos. The publishing will still have to be done manually, though. With <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/get-now\/\">JARVEE<\/a> you can schedule your Instagram posts and also automate other tedious tasks that cost you a lot of wasted time, everything completely automated so you can focus on more important aspects of your business.<\/p>\n<p>Also, use Instagram analytics tools to measure the effectiveness of your posts and to know the best time to post. If you use Instagram for business, you must track Instagram analytics. As with any other social network, you must have a strategy in place if you want to boost engagement.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram does not have its own analytics dashboard (unless you have a business account), but there are many tools you can use including <a href=\"http:\/\/iconosquare.com\/\">Iconosquare<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/simplymeasured.com\/\">Simply Measured<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/use-the-hashtag.png\" alt=\"use-the-hashtag\" width=\"369\" height=\"236\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2572\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/use-the-hashtag.png 369w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/use-the-hashtag-300x192.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 369px) 100vw, 369px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Use the Right Hashtags<\/h3>\n<p>When a user needs to find something on Instagram, they <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/10-hashtags-to-use-and-get-noticed-on-instagram\/\">use hashtags<\/a> to narrow down their search. Hashtags are labels for content and help people to find information on different topics quickly. If you are a seasoned Instagrammer, you know that there are popular hashtags and not-so-popular ones. If you use unpopular hashtags, your posts can easily go unnoticed \u2013 no matter how captivating they are. <\/p>\n<p>Use hashtag apps to choose the most popular hashtags in your industry. Some allow you to create your own set of hashtags so you can copy them whenever you want to use them. Always use some of the popular hashtags in your posts to increase the chances of reaching new users and getting discovered. But also look for targeted, niched hashtags to get more exposure in your target market. If you want to learn how to identify the right hashtags for you, check out this <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/complete-hashtag\u2026iche-with-jarvee\/ \">comprehensive tutorial<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To make your posts look clean, a good practice is to choose the most relevant 2 or 3 hashtags for the description and leave the rest for the comments. And don&#8217;t forget to include <a href=\"http:\/\/www.itchban.com\/blog\/2015\/3\/29\/instagram-hashtag-changes-march-2015\">all the necessary hashtags at the time of the posting<\/a>, otherwise, your photos will not appear near the top of the search results and your images could go unnoticed.<\/p>\n<h3>Utilize Photo Editing Tools and Apps<\/h3>\n<p>On an average day, about 95 million images are uploaded to Instagram. There is stiff competition for likes, and only outstanding photos attract the much-needed views. <\/p>\n<p>Make your Instagram posts stand out by using <a href=\"http:\/\/www.business2community.com\/instagram\/9-apps-supercharge-instagram-marketing-01334416\">photo editing tools and apps<\/a>. You can use them to adjust contrast, warmth, brightness, and saturation. Images look so much better when edited. Instagram has its own set of editing tools, and there are many apps at your disposal. They help you to share the beauty of a moment as you remember it \u2013 right inside Instagram.<\/p>\n<h3>Tag People in Images<\/h3>\n<p>Tagging on Instagram is currently available for the Android and iPhone apps. The process is super easy. You simply add the names or usernames of the people you want to tag. If you can\u2019t find a person, simply search for them. The beauty of tagging is that you can tag anyone in your photos \u2013 those who follow you and those who don\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>When you tag a person, they get a notification and your post becomes a part of their profile. This means that your followers and their followers see the post.<\/p>\n<h3>Engage With Your Followers<\/h3>\n<p>Make your brand become popular by regularly engaging with your fans. Remember that your fans follow you for a reason. If they ask questions or comment on your posts, do not ignore them. Even saying \u201cthanks\u201d for good comments makes your followers know you appreciate them. <\/p>\n<p>When you have time, leave nice and thoughtful comments on your fans\u2019 posts. Be thoughtful and avoid posting multiple photos at once as you\u2019ll clutter their photo feeds and they will not be happy. Spread out your posts evenly.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/instagram.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3112\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/instagram.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/instagram-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/instagram-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/instagram-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Partner with Influencers Who Support Your Brand\u2019s Values<\/h3>\n<p>Many businesses and brands on Instagram share and promote their partnerships. Partnerships increase brand awareness, reach, and revenue. When you partner with an Instagram influencer, you showcase your brand\u2019s offerings the best way.<\/p>\n<p>Bear in mind that social media influencers are today\u2019s celebrities. Instagram has more than 40,000 influencers who cover all fields. Their opinions are trusted and they can give credibility to the products and services they promote. Look for influencers in your industry to partner with. You can team up to create Instagram takeovers, contests, or product campaigns. Your posts will not only be viewed by many people, you\u2019ll increase brand awareness and get more fans.<\/p>\n<h3>Wrapping It Up<\/h3>\n<p>While Instagram is one of the best marketing tools for business, most brands do not go the extra mile and optimize their Instagram posts for further reach.<\/p>\n<p>Do not be like them.<\/p>\n<p>Use Instagram to make the most of your posts and to enjoy marketing success. Remember that Instagrammers are shoppers, if you post the right content, your fans will soak up your marketing messages without getting hard sales pitches from you.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram allows you to appeal to customers without selling to them directly.
