You are free to group your pins according to your preference.<\/p>\n<p>While you\u2019re pinning your Pinterest posts, you can add new boards to your profile or add them to existing ones. You are also able to edit a board\u2019s name and\/or description. How do you use these to your advantage?<\/p>\n<p>Make sure that you complete the board information upon making your pins. This enables your audience to learn what your board is about, consequently what your interest is. The more you learn about boards, the better your engagement rate will be.<\/p>\n<p>There are 7 parts in a Pinterest board to help you group your Pinterest posts. The 3 most essential parts are the name, description, and category. Make sure your board name is catchy, but at the same time is easily understandable by your audience. Make sure that you use keywords that could appear in Pinterest\u2019s search engine to make your board more popular. Categories are general pin classifications on Pinterest, and it is vital to have your board fall under one.<\/p>\n<p>To further enhance the popularity of your Pinterest boards, placing a cover, enabling the map feature, setting privacy, and enabling collaborators will also help with your Pinterest posts. Having the Map option selected will automatically make your board a place board. You may also want to select the audience of your board via the Secret toggle. The Collaborator part will help you gain more people to engage with your pins directly.<\/p>\n<p>Group boards are where you can place your Pinterest posts to increase your audience. These are shared boards where those you invite can freely pin. This is an effective tool especially for brainstorming different activities, projects, or just a venue to discuss similar interests.<\/p>\n<p>Use the Collaborators box in the board\u2019s edit page to invite people to your boards to share pins with. You may type their Pinterest username or email linked to the software, of which they will be notified of the invitation. This makes the board more intimate since you have personally chosen the people to share pins with.<\/p>\n<p>Proper management of your group boards for your pins is something to be noted. Be conscious of the people who you send invitations to. Make sure that their interests are aligned with the board you are inviting them to be part of. Otherwise, you might be wasting both your time and theirs.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/marketing.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3293\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/marketing.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/marketing-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/marketing-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/marketing-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>#2 Pinterest Posts with Calls to Action<\/h3>\n<p>Pinterest posts with a call to action (CTA) also get more engagement than those without. In the marketing context, this instructs the audience to provoke a response immediately. Imperative statements are commonly used in social media, such as \u201cclick this link\u2026\u201d, \u201cVisit now!\u201d or \u201clike this post\u2026\u201d In Pinterest posts, you may also opt to use \u201crepin this\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Pinterest posts with CTA have an 80% increase in engagement than those without CTAs. This makes people more involved with what you are interested in. They perceive a sense of value to their participation by this sense of urgency you create for them to do.<\/p>\n<p>Though you may want to have CTAs in most of your Pinterest posts, you ought to pace yourself when doing this. People may eventually get annoyed, and lose interest in your board (or worse in your account) altogether. You may also be perceived as desperate, which the audience does not have time for in this fast-paced social media scene.<\/p>\n<p>Should you choose to have links to be clicked in your Pinterest posts, it is advisable to not use bitly. Pinterest has programmed a bit.ly link as spam. When this is used, a prompt appears indicating that the link is blocked. With this, it is important to make sure that links you post will redirect the user to the appropriate site.<\/p>\n<h3>#3 Rich Pins<\/h3>\n<p><b>Rich Pins<\/b> are Pinterest posts that have extra information on the pin itself. Rich pins are of 6 types: app, article, movie, place, and recipe. Depending on the available content of your pin, you may choose from the aforementioned to make your post directly more informative.

Compared with horizontal images, vertical images will also help in easy reading of your text as well. If this shape is not what you prefer, you may opt for the standard recommended dimension of 735&#215;1102.<\/p>\n<h3>#5 Pinterest Posts with a Unique Take on Popular Topics<\/h3>\n<p>Your unique perspective on popular topics is what will make your Pinterest posts more engaging.
