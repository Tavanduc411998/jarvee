The Internet and social networks are full of opportunities and valuable information, but if you don\u2019t know where to look for potential customers and what tools to use in this process, then even the internet can be a tabula rasa.<\/p>\n<p>Here we are going to show you some proven methods for getting new leads and potential clients on Facebook with Jarvee.<\/p>\n<p>If you already used Jarvee until now, you are probably familiar with the <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/knowledge-base\/contact\/\">Contact tool<\/a> and you know that it\u2019s one of the main tools for Facebook, but you probably didn\u2019t use all of its power and you probably didn\u2019t pay attention to all the possibilities of Extract Members feature. In this article, we will share with you some eye-opening tips that should shake your creativity and give you some new ideas.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8393 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/facebook-extract-members-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"323\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/facebook-extract-members-1.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/facebook-extract-members-1-300x121.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/facebook-extract-members-1-768x310.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/facebook-extract-members-1-600x242.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Extract friends of a specific user<\/h2>\n<p>When you are looking for people that could be interested in what you have to offer, whether you are offering service or product, you have to imagine this type of person and think about the type of personalities they have, think about their interests, hobbies, and other things they would like.<\/p>\n<p>One of the basic ways to search for this kind of person is to find people that have some similarities with them and those could be their Facebook friends. That being said, you can find your customers on Facebook and then extract their friends.<\/p>\n<p>In order to extract friends of some Facebook user, you need to use this type of link: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/zuck\/friends<\/p>\n<p>To get this link, you need to visit a profile and go to the Friends tab of that user, and then use the link that you\u2019ll get on that page. Now you just need to go to the Contact tool &gt; Extract Members tab &gt; add the link &gt; set the scroll time and click on Extract Users.<\/p>\n<h2>Extract people that are interested in some Facebook events<\/h2>\n<p>When you visit some Facebook event page, the link will look like this: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/163744315134056545x<\/p>\n<p>You can use this link to extract your friends that are interested to attend some event or those that confirmed that they are going to some event. When you visit some event you will be able to see these lists there.<\/p>\n<p>To explore existing events, go to your Facebook profile &gt; click on Events section and from there look for events that would be interesting for the type of person you imagined as your potential customer.<\/p>\n<h2>Extract people that liked posts from a specific page<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to extract people that liked posts that belong to a specific page, you can just use the link of that page &gt; add it to the Extract Members tool and start extraction. This option is useful if you want to extract some users that liked your posts, but they might not be your clients yet.<\/p>\n<p>The second situation where you can use this option is if you want to extract people that liked posts from your competitor\u2019s page and reach them.<\/p>\n<h2>Extract people that have a specific name<\/h2>\n<p>When you want to extract Facebook users that have a specific name such as John for example, you need to type John in the Facebook search and click on the people card on the left. Or you can use this link example and place it to your Extract Members tool: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/search\/people\/?q=john<\/p>\n<p>This can be useful for example if you have some products that are personalized and you want to offer it with a specifically created product example with that name.<\/p>\n<p>Also, there are still some smaller companies that use regular profiles to offer their services or products. In this case, you can for example type \u201ccleaning\u201d and with the link, you will get you can extract these profiles if you have something that you can offer to other businesses.<\/p>\n<p>There could also be some very common names that you want to target from a specific country and in that case you could use this feature.<\/p>\n<h2>Extract Friends Suggestions<\/h2>\n<p>When you just want to extract your friends suggestions that you get from Facebook automatically, you can use this link:\u00a0 https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/find-friends\/browser<\/p>\n<p>This could be useful if you created a new profile account that you want to use for business purposes. Or it can be used if you just want to grow your existing profile with people you may know already.<\/p>\n<h2>Extract all pages that you liked<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to collect some kind of list of pages that would be interesting for your potential customers, you can like these pages and then easily extract them through this tool. Then you will have a list of these pages that you can use to extract people that liked their posts &#8211; and bingo! these all could be your potential sales.<\/p>\n<p>This is the link that you can use to get to these pages: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/?category=liked&amp;ref=bookmarks<\/p>\n<h2>Extract members of a specific group<\/h2>\n<p>Groups are places where people of similar or the same interest gather and share their ideas and opinions. Look for groups that should be part of your client\u2019s interest and extract members of these groups. There is a high probability that some of these members will be interested in what you have to offer.<\/p>\n<p>This is a link example, you need to go to the group &gt; go to Members tab and copy the link: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/2848440548709097\/members<\/p>\n<p>You can also find your \u201cideal\u201d customer and then go through the groups that he is part of. This way you will find a list of groups where your potential clients can be.<\/p>\n<h2>Extract people that liked posts from a specific group<\/h2>\n<p>If you are a member of a specific group or if you want to get this information from a public group, you can extract users that liked posts from a specific group. This way you can spot those users that are very interested in some topic that could be an area of your niche as well. This extraction can take you a step closer to winning a new customer that is just waiting for you to reach him.<\/p>\n<p>This is the link that you can use for the extraction: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/nameofthegroup<\/p>\n<h2>Extract people that liked a specific post in a specific group<\/h2>\n<p>Since you are probably already part of many groups that are related to your niche, try finding some posts that are related to some product or service that is as similar as possible to what you are offering. Then you can extract users that liked this post and take advantage of the fact that they already like the idea of it. You can take a permalink of that post and extract likers of that post in just a few steps.<\/p>\n<h2>Extract people who interact with a page post<\/h2>\n<p>This is the last but not the least possibility of this tool. Quite the opposite, this is one of the most interesting cases, where you can extract users that interacted with posts on a specific page. This is very useful as you can easily find users that could be interested in your offerings by finding them on your competitors&#8217; pages that do the same stuff as you. Or if you have an active page that gets many interactions, you could also use your own page as a source.<\/p>\n<p>This is from where you can get a link for a specific post from Facebook page:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/facebook-link-post.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"393\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Note that all the actions you will do have to be done from a profile account. You could do it from your private account if it\u2019s appropriate or you could create your own company profile from where you will be doing further actions.<\/p>\n<p>Hope that you got some ideas that will be useful for you and that it will lead you to your new customers.<\/p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t tried Jarvee yet, you can try it for free <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/get-now\/\">here<\/a>.
