With over 2 billion users, the platform is way too big to be excluded from the promotional strategy, so the only question is how to get the most of it and use all the features currently available.<\/p>\n<p>Despite being three years old already, Facebook reactions are just starting to receive the attention they deserve and now make one of the most promising marketing tools in the social media universe. This is why every marketer should understand the mechanisms behind this feature and take advantage of it to promote the brand more successfully.<\/p>\n<p>Our post will show you practical ways to use Facebook reactions in your marketing strategy. Let\u2019s take a look!<\/p>\n<h2>Behind the Scenes of Facebook Reactions<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook reactions are practically the extensions of the ancient &#8220;Like&#8221; button that give users more possibilities to express their feelings or opinions toward any given topic.<\/p>\n<p>Margot Galvan, a social media manager at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bestessays.com.au\/\">BestEssays<\/a>, believes reactions have not been so popular until recently because they require additional effort: \u201cWhile the \u2018Like\u2019 button takes only one click, other reactions are not as effortless because you need to wait for a while and then precisely target one of the five other emoticons.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>However, the situation is gradually changing as the Facebook user are familiarizing with this feature. People love to express emotions and there is always a big increase in reactions in the time of national holidays or important social discussions.<\/p>\n<p>According to the report, users share the most reactions (Love in particular) on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/4031245\/facebook-reactions-the-first-year-in-stats\">Christmas<\/a>. Regardless of the timing, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/183393\/us-facebook-user-habits\/\">Love (41%)<\/a> is the most popular Facebook reaction, followed by Haha (28%) and Wow (15%), while the last two spots go to Sad (12%) and Angry (5%) emoticons.<\/p>\n<p>With the number of users willing to display emotions continuously growing, the real dilemma is how to utilize Facebook reactions for the benefits of your brand. While the number of options is almost countless because it depends on your inspiration and creativity, we can recommend 5 highly practical ways to make use of this valuable Facebook feature. Here they are:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Collect relevant data<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Facebook reactions allow users to show emotions more accurately, which in turn helps you to collect relevant data. Now you can keep an eye on users to detect their behavioral patterns, thus getting a valuable feedback. What does it mean?<\/p>\n<p>Well, it means you can measure the results of your content to learn which topics drive engagement and which ones chase users away. Besides that, you can precisely determine the types of posts which inspire positive or negative feedback.<\/p>\n<p>In such circumstances, business intelligence becomes more relevant and gives you the opportunity to improve Facebook marketing strategy in the long run.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Audience segmentation<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Gone are the days when you could simply exercise \u201cone size fits all\u201d campaigns and target followers with generic messages. This is not possible anymore, so you have to segment the audience to provide each user with the sort of content she\/he loves the most. Facebook reactions give you the perfect opportunity to distinguish between different types of followers. That way, you can create relevant categories and craft the corresponding marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Create better content<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>When you know what your Facebook followers love, hate, or laugh at, it\u2019s easy to design content that matches their specific needs or expectations. You can fine-tune posts so as to maximize their impact and reduce marketing waste to the minimum. Besides that, the story is by no means one-sided.<\/p>\n<p>On the contrary, we strongly believe Facebook is going to engage in this process even further and change newsfeed algorithms so as to display more relevant content. A vast majority of social media experts think that reactions have a greater value than sheer likes, so it\u2019s natural to expect more emotion-driving content on Facebook soon enough.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Targeted Facebook advertising<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Facebook advertising is yet another field where reactions can make a significant impact. Using emotional targeting, you can now run ads that perfectly correspond with the feelings, lifestyle, and values of your target audience.<\/p>\n<p>There is also the option of placing ads next to the posts inspiring different emotions. For instance, you can choose to position your ads below content which inspires positive reactions such as love or laughter. That way, the brand could ride the wave of positive emotions and hope to inspire some more user engagement.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Improve Facebook marketing performance<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>With everything you\u2019ve seen so far, it is completely natural to expect your Facebook marketing to grow bigger and become more effective. A reaction-based strategy has the potential to raise brand awareness, generate fresh leads, and ultimately drive extra revenue.<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook reactions have been there for three years already, but it took them a while to really entice users and become a popular means of online interaction. Today, they make a crucial marketing tool that you must utilize to promote the brand more efficiently.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we showed you some practical ways to use Facebook reactions in your marketing strategy. It\u2019s a feature that breathes new life into Facebook marketing, so make sure to spend more time thinking about it because it can earn you more followers and fresh leads.<\/p>\n<p><em>Author Bio:<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Warren is a marketing enthusiast and a blogger at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bestessays.com.au\/\">BestEssays<\/a>, who loves music.
