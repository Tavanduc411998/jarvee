This time, it is planning to smash the chatroom industry with its audio-only chat rooms.<\/p>\n<p>Though the idea is in pipeline, it sounds interesting and impressive. If you\u2019re an avid chatroom user and looking forward to this feature, read this post as we are going to spill every bean about this hot topic.<\/p>\n<p>Before we begin, let\u2019s find out how popular Facebook ch\u00a0at rooms are.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/558283\/number-of-fb-messenger-users-usa\/\">As per Statista<\/a>, Facebook Messenger is being used by 126.3 million US users for communicating with the rest of the world. If the same growth has been followed rigorously, this figure is likely to touch the mark of 138.1 million by the end of 2022.<\/p>\n<p>Every month, more than 1.8 billion users are engaged in Facebook. All these figures are impressive and show that Facebook is a favorite of many and with this new feature, it will attract more users. Now, let\u2019s talk about this all-new and thrilling feature.<\/p>\n<h1>Audio-only Rooms &#8211; The Clubhouse\u2019s clone from the house of Facebook<\/h1>\n<p>Yes, you read it right. The Audio-only rooms that Facebook is planning to launch are actually the clone of Clubhouse.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/clubhouse-the-new-social-media-platform-for-brands\/\">clubhouse<\/a> has already won many hearts. Within a year, the app was managed to score 13 million downloads. One of the key reasons behind its success was audio rooms. This audio social networking app lets the broadcaster host live shows for a particular listener.<\/p>\n<p>Elon Musk and even the brain-behind-Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/clubhouse-the-new-social-media-platform-for-brands\/\">have used Clubhouse app<\/a> to have a T\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with their followers. Elon Musk organized the live reading of The Lion King musical and many liked it. His recent appearance at the Clubhouse broke the room limit. People started created multiple secondary listening rooms and live-streams of his session.<\/p>\n<p>The audio-only rooms are more engaging and people are falling in love with this feature. Then <a href=\"https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/using-twitter\/spaces\">Twitter\u2019s Spaces<\/a> is all set to get launched. Twitter has made its intention all cleared that Spaces will be on the floor by April. This feature will allow broadcasters to reach a wider group of audience at least possible hassles.<\/p>\n<p>If this one also worked out, Facebook needs to worry a bit. After all, Facebook can\u2019t afford to lose the battle. Hence, it decided to give Clubhouse a tough competition with this new feature. The feature is under the back-end coding stage and is known to allow users to create personal audio rooms for friends.<\/p>\n<p>Most likely, it is going to be a part of Messenger Rooms. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alex193a\">Alessandro Paluzzi<\/a>, a reverse engineer, developer and creator of WATweaker, tweeted about this new feature.<\/p>\n<h1><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8591 \" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/social-media.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"798\" height=\"532\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/social-media.png 865w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/social-media-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/social-media-768x512.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/social-media-600x400.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 798px) 100vw, 798px\" \/><br \/>\nThe Possible Traits<\/h1>\n<p>Since the news of Facebook\u2019s audio-only rooms is out, people have started talking about it. Some are even thinking how it will look like. If you\u2019re also wondering the same, read the below-explained text.<\/p>\n<p>As per the news and reports, Facebook&#8217;s version will look like a chat app and will have speakers showed up at the top of users\u2019 profiles. The user list will have bigger e profile images. The members of the audio-only rooms will be showed up below the speaker. The speaker\u2019s profile image will be smaller.<\/p>\n<p>The reports and speculations also say that anyone from Facebook\u2019s user-base can be a part of a broadcast without being actually a part of Messenger Room. Using this feature, end-users can create audio broadcasts and keep them open for everyone. Those who are interested can join in, using the Facebook Messenger app.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alex193a\/status\/1371755619045105669\">As per the screenshot that Paluzzi<\/a> has posted the audio room will be available under the \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d section of Facebook\u2019s homepage. This button is present on the same bar that displays the people\u2019s Facebook stories. Soon after a user tap on Create Room button, users can either create live audio rooms or private audio room. Public rooms are open for all while private rooms are restricted.<\/p>\n<p>Rumors also say that it looks like Twitter\u2019s Fleet feature. This one is a no-brainer as we all know how open is Facebook to replicate and steal other\u2019s ideas.<\/p>\n<p>Remember how soon it replicated the Instagram Storied feature in 2016. The idea was inspired by Snapchat.<\/p>\n<p>The Like button was replicated from Friendfeed in 2007.<\/p>\n<p>The Instagram Reels feature is inspired by TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>Users have no concerned with these replications as long as they are having great experience in chat rooms and enjoying engaging chatting.<\/p>\n<h1>Facebook &#8211; The innovation hub<\/h1>\n<p>This is not the first time that Facebook is coming up with an interesting feature. Last year, in 2020, the social networking giant added the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/help\/messenger-app\/819584731857901\">video room feature through Messenger Rooms<\/a>. Using this feature, users were able to create personal video chat rooms that anyone can join. This feature was applauded by the crowd.<\/p>\n<p>The latest addition works in the same manner but works with less data load because the video is not used. If you\u2019re wondering how it might feel to be a part of an audio-only room, imaging joining your favorite Facebook group, seeing the members going live with audio, and you can be part of the conversation.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike video-based chatting, the performance pressure reduces here. Hence, the members will feel less pressurized and more casual. Those who are not comfortable facing a camera but have interesting ideas to share and use this feature to reach out to the audience.<\/p>\n<h1>Waiting is the only option<\/h1>\n<p>All these things sound interesting and we won\u2019t be surprised to hear if you say that you\u2019re excited for this feature to come to the floor. It is actually a very interesting feature. But, Facebook hasn\u2019t provided any detail about when this feature will be live for users. Even the company has instructed its employees not to talk about this feature publically. So, you have no option rather than waiting for it.<\/p>\n<p>Seeing its facilities, we can only say that it\u2019s worth the wait as you will have a more interesting and engaging experience. Don\u2019t worry; the moment Facebook reveals any detail, we will keep you posted. Till then, happy messaging and stay tuned.<\/p>\n<h1>Author bio<\/h1>\n<div><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Florian Berg has more than 15 years of experience in the field of data protection &amp; cybersecurity.\u00a0<\/span>This, in turn, has enabled him to create a trusted website\u00a0<a class=\"gmail-c-link\" href=\"http:\/\/en.vpnwelt.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">en.vpnwelt.com<\/a>\u00a0with the best VPN services.\u00a0His goal is to share his experience and to support users with questions regarding privacy policy and protection.<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook leaves no stone unturned to stay on top and become everyone\u2019s favorite way to connect with the world.
