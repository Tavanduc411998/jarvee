You should try to pick up the skill of automating your posting. You\u2019ll be able to save so much of your time that you spend on social media updates, even up to <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/schedule-facebook-marketing-jarvee-10-minutes-less\/\">a month load<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/social-media.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"531\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2418\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/social-media.jpeg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/social-media-300x199.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/social-media-768x510.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/social-media-600x398.jpeg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It may be that social media is an exciting environment, always changing, but it\u2019s always still a good idea to start planning your updates ahead of time. You can still take the time to post real-time posts when you feel the need to and when you have the most available time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are some reasons you should create a media content calendar and why you should get started with social media automation for successful marketing campaigns on all the social platforms:<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3>#1\u00a0Being Real and Consistent<\/h3>\n<p>You should have your subscribers in tune with your social accounts and your posting schedule. It can be confusing and irritating for them if you flood them with posts one day, and then seem to not post a single thing the next.<\/p>\n<p>The moment you start automating your posts and set-up the exact time when to share, you will give your audience predictability. They need to know when they should expect updates from you. This will help increase your chances of them actually being updated and looking forward to your posts.<\/p>\n<p>Honestly, you get the best results when you can combine media automation and your own personal input. <\/p>\n<p>Checking in to be interactive with your audience on the most important posts will make people feel more connected and will willingly try to reach out to you. This is a great way for you to still enjoy social media, but not losing yourself to all its constant distractions.<\/p>\n<h3>#2 Extended and Fullproof<\/h3>\n<p>Having your content scheduled at certain times will help you connect with people all around the world, even if some of them from halfway across the world are asleep while you\u2019re working.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook Insights can help out with this. You can use the data provided by Facebook to analyse your audience and research the best time to share your posts. This will help you know when is the best time to share your content for the best audience reach.<\/p>\n<p>By practicing social media automation you\u2019ll get to plan your posts in advance and really get intuitive with your ideas, possibly even catch eventual errors before you make the mistake of publishing them. This is a foolproof plan that can help rid you of those embarrassing mistakes.<\/p>\n<h3>#3 Content and Its Shares<\/h3>\n<p>Having <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jeffbullas.com\/2015\/05\/27\/why-you-should-get-serious-about-social-media-automation\/\">a clear strategy<\/a> in mind in regards to media automation means you can determine how you are going to balance out the numerous content that you post all over social media. You have the choice and say on the certain amount of photos, links, regular texts and even videos. This all depends on your goals as a brand and your target market. However, with social media automation, you can help guide your audience to what you think is best instead of just leaving it to chance.<\/p>\n<p>You have the tools to spread the right amount of content. Using this strategy will help you prepare updates throughout the day, which will help you avoid overwhelming your subscribers with too much content. You can use your extra time to interact with these future customers and concentrate more efforts on getting more sales.<\/p>\n<h3>#4\u00a0Strategy and Productivity<\/h3>\n<p>When you think about it, with social media automation, <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.drumup.io\/blog\/social-media-automation-7-reasons-why-its-a-must-have-in-your-social-media-marketing-strategy\/\">having control<\/a> over everything you share with your audience opens the door to giving you the upper hand in looking after your success and comparing numerous approaches. You can go right ahead and plan your updates, and still have the choice to change anything based on results and when you feel the need to. Based on an audience who is constantly changing, you\u2019ll want to be able to keep up with them too.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also like you get to have more time available in a single day. You spend minimum time scheduling a bunch of posts and then you get more time to use on some other important tasks. To get more exposure, you can practice this so that people who aren\u2019t online when you send out your post, can still get to see it when they get the time.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/social-media-marketing.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2419\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/social-media-marketing.jpeg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/social-media-marketing-150x150.jpeg 150w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/social-media-marketing-300x300.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/social-media-marketing-768x768.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/social-media-marketing-600x600.jpeg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>#5 Relevance of Social Media Automation<\/h3>\n<p>Imagine that with the help of social media automation, you can take one to two hours, 1 day a week and layout your plans for an entire week&#8217;s worth of posts. This is a strategic way for you not to be hurried in publishing anything manually. You will be able to spend more time gathering ideas and using them in your brand\u2019s image of the content. The flow of this specific strategy is what will help you understand more and reflect better on your brand&#8217;s goals.<\/p>\n<p>Without the pressure of having to come up with thoughtful posts every few moments in a day, you\u2019ll be able to decrease stress levels. It\u2019s as easy as setting aside a couple of hours to think over all your concepts and formulate a plan. No need to search any longer for the last minute brain racking inspiration, you\u2019ll avoid all of that \u201cwriter&#8217;s block\u201d and not have to worry about delays in your posting.<\/p>\n<h3>Wrapping it Up<\/h3>\n<p>With the help of social media automation, you\u2019ll be able to plan out updates for important events without having to even think about needing that advance month&#8217;s\u2019 notice. You won\u2019t have to contemplate whether you have enough content or if your social updates are in line with the brand&#8217;s marketing plans.<\/p>\n<p>Like what I mentioned earlier you can always step in and do some manual updates if you need to, at least you\u2019ll be at ease knowing you can plan in advance. You won\u2019t have to come back on planned posts and edit them like you\u2019d usually have to.<\/p>\n<p>Even more so, by using an <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/\">all-in-one scheduling software<\/a>, you get to save hours of your time, simply because you can schedule group posts, handle real-time posts with ease even though it&#8217;s manually and even engage with an audience who can\u2019t automate.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s always important to remember that social media is all about interaction, being engaged and entertaining conversations. We\u2019re not suggesting that you have to automate every little detail, just remember that this is a strategy to help you keep your content posted at the right time and will help make it all for the benefit of your brand and its presence online.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It seems as though these are the days when your to-do list just keeps piling up and your stress levels seem to get a little too high.
