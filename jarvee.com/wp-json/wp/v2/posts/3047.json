If you weren\u2019t aware of this already, Pinterest is one of the leading visual social platforms, along with big players like Instagram. With over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.omnicoreagency.com\/pinterest-statistics\/\">175 million Monthly Active Users and over 50 billion Pinterest Pins<\/a>, there\u2019s really no denying the powerful reach that this latest social platform has.<\/p>\n<p>Going back to the big question on how to grow your Pinterest following, there\u2019s honestly no real \u201cprocess\u201d in doing so. Most people just experiment, trying to avoid buying their followers. A lot of people tried using their other social platforms as means to invite followers to their Pinterest feed. Would you believe that this little trick actually works? <\/p>\n<p>So wondering how these people did it, we decided to collect some data and give you the 5 strategies to grow your Pinterest following, with a bit of trial and error along the way of course.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-search.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3568\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-search.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-search-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-search-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-search-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>#1 Grow Your Pinterest Following by Making Your Account Easy to Find<\/h3>\n<p>When we say easy to find, we mean it. If you can get people to find your account with just the use of one word, then, by all means, that\u2019s what should be happening. Make things easier, when it comes to your brand&#8217;s name, make things as self-explanatory as possible to grow your Pinterest following.<\/p>\n<p>You can practice this by using keywords when you fill in the brief\u00a0description on your Pinterest home page. Though there is only space for about 200 words, it doesn\u2019t hold you back as long as you capture the branding of your company. Take the time to verify your website, include links to your other social platforms so that you get that advantage on increased visibility.<\/p>\n<p>Using your current social networks is a great way to grow your Pinterest following. The followings you already have on platforms like Facebook, Instagram or Twitter <a href=\"http:\/\/growmap.com\/grow-pinterest-followers\/\">provide a great leverage<\/a>. You can try providing real incentives. Think of creative ways that would encourage others to join you on the new platform. Remember that the social media game is one of \u201cclever tactics\u201d.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-boards.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"750\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3562\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-boards.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-boards-300x281.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-boards-768x720.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-boards-600x563.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>#2 Take Personal Care of Your Pinterest Boards<\/h3>\n<p>Give an adequate amount of time for your boards, go through them and give them descriptions. A good way to grow your Pinterest following is to use keywords that make sense to each board. Take into consideration the kinds of searches that will lead people to your boards. Work out what times of the day are busy times on Pinterest, this will help you in generating more traffic.<\/p>\n<p>You should also practice categorizing them, into different categories on the Pinterest feed. This is one reason you can sometimes find such random posts in certain category feeds. You should also practice this to give your boards flare and a sense of uniform, this will really help you grow your Pinterest following. Give your boards beauty by having an aesthetic flow throughout the entire profile.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re branding with something techy, and your boards are all about recipes or the latest fashion; you are most likely going to make your followers confuse and lose their interest. It\u2019s wisest to dedicate your boards to the industry your brand operates around.\u00a0 This will serve you two ultimate purposes. One is for the brand itself and to promote the interest of a variety of followers. Two is to keep these great results for your business and to stay focused on quality and useful, interesting content.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-pins.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3563\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-pins.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-pins-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-pins-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-pins-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>#3 Make the Most Out of Your Pins<\/h3>\n<p>If your content is a constant show up on the platform searches, it will help followers recognize you as a trusted source. It should be one of your goals to make your content easy to share on the Pinterest platform\u00a0so that you can grow your Pinterest following. You can practice this by making sure you have a minimum of one pinnable image in a post. This also means ONLY pinning quality images, because these are the ones more likely to get repinned.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure to have a proper description with each of your pins on your boards. You don\u2019t necessarily have to go crazy overthinking about it, sometimes a single keyword that can be searched will do. <a href=\"http:\/\/designinganmba.com\/2013\/09\/03\/how-i-grew-my-pinterest-following\/\">Call it as it is<\/a>, be direct so that your followers have the least time finding it.\u00a0 This also makes it handy for if you ever need to find it again in a sea of pins. Also, practice pinning only the things that you actually like for the brand. People will only catch on if you\u2019re consistent, this is a big help to grow your Pinterest following. Let your boards and pins speak for the brand, this will make everything easier to maintain in the long run.<\/p>\n<p>You can add a \u201cPin It\u201d button to your website to get more traffic from your site to your Pinterest account. This will help people connect and share more of your content. A little tip is that content on Pinterest is still searchable even after months of having been posted. So pinning your content will definitely help increase the span of your followers significantly.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/content-marketing.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"465\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3565\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/content-marketing.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/content-marketing-300x174.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/content-marketing-768x446.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/content-marketing-600x349.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>#4 Your Content is a Big Deal<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s probably now time to master your skills in curating seasonal content. One way to grow your Pinterest following\u00a0is having a seasonal board because let\u2019s face it, you\u2019ll want to be sharing trending information.<\/p>\n<p>If it\u2019s a holiday people will be searching for posts exactly about that. September is notorious for Halloween gimmicks, people start searching for costumes, d\u00e9cor ideas just like in December for Christmas people start going after new recipes and table set-ups. Take the kill on these times, have your board full of content related to a brand at the same time related to what people are looking for. Use these kinds of trends to inspire branding and marketing strategies. Maybe it\u2019s time for a new layout or profile change? Followers just might end up following all of your boards.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also a good idea to start thinking about <a href=\"http:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/2016\/01\/grow-pinterest-following\/\">user-generated content<\/a>. It\u2019s a little-known fact that it is \u201c35% more memorable and 50% more trustworthy\u201d than most types of content. This means that you should give importance to the role it could play in helping you\u00a0grow your Pinterest Following.<\/p>\n<p>You can create a collaborative board to allow your followers to post photos of how they choose to interact with your brand&#8217;s products and services. This will help you make the most out of user-generated content. If you encourage this kind of collaboration, you\u2019ll be practicing how you engage with your brand and your followers. It\u2019s sure to be a hit.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/branding.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3564\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/branding.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/branding-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/branding-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/branding-600x338.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>#5 Its All About Building the Brand<\/h3>\n<p>This probably doesn\u2019t need to be said, but it is important to remember that your use for Pinterest should be all about building the brand. This is why you need to dedicate your boards to relate with both what you as a marketer and your brand do. Have boards about products, have ones about services, you can also have ones about motivational messages related to the brand and possibly upcoming campaigns. You have to be able to put personality into whatever it is your marketing on the platform, this is what really will help you grow your Pinterest following.<\/p>\n<p>So don\u2019t forget to engage with your followers. It\u2019s a common thing that most people don\u2019t use Pinterest to engage with other people, however, you should take the time to check out other people&#8217;s pins. Maybe leave genuine comments for those loyal followers. Give out interesting tips if they happen to ask, and take notice of your following.\u00a0 This is the ultimate thing that can lead to people wanting to follow along with your pins.<\/p>\n<p>Pinterest isn\u2019t a social platform used to communicate with other people. That is why there\u2019s Instagram and Twitter for instances when we want to mingle with people. However, liking other people\u2019s pins, leaving genuine comments about their pins are useful and interesting to make people take notice of you. This could eventually lead to someone who might be interested in your pins and even follows you.<\/p>\n<p>Look into who is pinning around what you pin on your blog. These are the people who actually show interest in your brand and the content you post. These are the perfect candidates for the kind of following that you want.<\/p>\n<h3>Wrapping it up<\/h3>\n<p>With these strategies in mind, the last thing you should probably give importance to is to stay active. This goes the same for any social platform you work with. \u00a0You should always be updating your boards and posting fresh content. You don\u2019t necessarily have to make it time-consuming.<\/p>\n<p>Just remember that it boils down to the more content you can generate, the more boards you\u2019ll have; the more boards you have, the more content there is available for pinning and repining by your followers for people&#8217;s searches.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With so many users starting to grace the social platform that is Pinterest, the constant question that nags at everyone is how to grow your Pinterest following.
