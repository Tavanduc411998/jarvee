They are a great way to bridge the gap between traditional, regular word-of-mouth and a viral feedback form.<\/p>\n<p>Collecting customer reviews can be incredibly simple if you integrate some kind of feedback option on your site; you could even offer incentives such as 10% off a future order to persuade people to leave a review.
