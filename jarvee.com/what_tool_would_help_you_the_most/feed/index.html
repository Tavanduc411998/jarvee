I guess you&#039;re referring to Instagram here and I&#039;m afraid that&#039;s not possible since IG doesn&#039;t show account&#039;s country publicly. There&#039;s option to target by geo location, but that&#039;s related to location that user tagged in one of their posts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Please make it easier to create Set Uploads, like if i want a picture to be uploaded at 20 o clock daily and i could just insert it as easy as gramblr for example (but i dont use it because it follows users without permission). 

just an easy quick tool where you could prepare and auto-upload, because i dont really get how to do that on jarvee yet.

Thanks by the way &#060;3]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi guys!

That would be good if we can see more details after JARVEE says &quot;0 from 5-10000 users passed FOLLOW/LIKE/etc filters after scraping&quot; so a little more deep information about filters behaviour in a given set of source. That would be better for us to get know better the sources also.

Many Thanks]]></description>

Great idea here. Or at least have Jarvee support scrapping commenters or likers by username or by batches of posts&#039; links, so you don&#039;t have to scrape post by post, link by link, manually. That alone would help. Then you massage the data yourself to find whatever you need from it, no problem with that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In my personal order of need (IG &#038; FB): 

#1. Advanced Analytics: 
a) in-depth knowledge of my own audience
b) 2nd lvl performance analytics of my content in order for me to replicate successes and understand failures- based on “Lean Startup” philosophy.  
c)finding/monitoring/spying/benchamarking competition: their content, their audience. 

#2. Content finder and curation for specific niche. But it could include feature like iOS goTrends app has so it would be less time consuming to create engaging question/call to action for the post based on relevence/humor for audience from specific country. I understand that its planed as separate tool but home it will allow us to connect it with Jarvee’s automatic publishing tool. 

#3. Universal Inbox: makeing as least time consuming responding to comments/likes/dm under first 60 min would greatly help with my content performance and user engagement.

#4. Hashtags: Automating process from Jarvee’s tutorial (published here on forums) for proper hashtag serach would be nice.]]></description>

Best targets
Daily, Weekly, Monthly gain
Best followers (Who engages etc)

					<description><![CDATA[Something that is a must, would be for the auto re pin feature for Pinterest... IT NEEDS THE ABLITY TO ADD YOUR OWN URL TO THE RE PIN

I understand this works on upload by csv, but it needs to be on the auto scraper/re pin section in tools.

Please add this. :)

Thanks for your hard work]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think advanced analytics and viral content finding would be super useful tools! These two always take a bit of time to figure out, and it&#039;s not always easy to know why an image went viral on a competitor page - it could be time of day or week, hashtags, the content in the image etc. 

Thanks for your dedicated work Jarvee team, you do a fantastic job!]]></description>
