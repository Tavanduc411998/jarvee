I find that I need to use this ability more, but also see so many using it way too much. So&#8230; standing out in a positive way is not easy. I have decided to make use of video here and there, make it something special, and when I think it adds value, instead of bombarding people constantly. You need to see how you can tell stories, create narratives, build relationships, communicate with consumers, and create learning for your organization&#8230; but pay attention to your relationships and connection nodes, and be sure to evolve as you go, and don&#8217;t lose sight of what was working before and still does. If you are only focused on the Money&#8230; You risk completely overlooking the People.<\/p>\n<p>Always remember what is crucial in marketing is achieving your goals without doing damage to your brand. Customer experience is what will grow and sustain your brand over the long-term. So&#8230; if video content for social media facilitates that, cost-effectively, then by all means it is important. If not&#8230; then it most certainly is not.<\/p>\n<p>Your Brand\/Business is what you do; your Reputation is what people Remember and Share.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ted Rubin<\/strong> &#8211; a leading Social Marketing Strategist, Keynote Speaker, Acting CMO of <a href=\"https:\/\/brand-innovators.com\/\">Brand Innovators<\/a> , and Co-Founder of the recently launched <a href=\"https:\/\/prevailingpath.com\/\">Prevailing Path<\/a> .<\/p>\n<p>Find him on Twitter at <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tedrubin\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/tedrubin<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/separator.png\" alt=\"separator\" width=\"426\" height=\"118\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3183\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/separator.png 426w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/separator-300x83.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3120\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Dorien-Morin-van-Dam-Social-media-consultant-and-coach.jpg\" alt=\"Dorien Morin-van Dam - Social media consultant and coach\" width=\"300\" height=\"230\" \/>Content marketing without video is like eating a Peanut butter &amp; Jelly Sandwich without the Jelly.

Not only are social media platforms weighting the scales in favor of more people being able to see that type of content, but it also resonates more with your audience when done right. It allows people to use more of their senses, and have a more &#8220;real&#8221; experience with the person they are following. So take advantage of that! Think about color, light, and sound when you create your videos. Engage with facial expressions and tone of voice. Try to visualize the person on the other side of the screen, and talk right to them.

However, in 2018, we are seeing video become especially important for social media because many social media algorithms are starting to favor it. On Facebook, video content gets better reach and engagement than other types of posts. Mark Zuckerberg has been vocal about the fact that he believes Facebook will consist entirely of video content in the next 5 years. This is largely due to the fact that people want video. We have short attention spans, and watching is more appealing than reading for many people. Millennial audiences (who most marketers want to target) prefer video over any other form of content because it&#8217;s easier to process, more immediate and more straightforward.<\/p>\n<p>Think of all the ways video content has become important in our lives &#8211; from videos on websites and social media to live-streaming through sites like Netflix and Hulu. (Video streaming accounts for 2\/3 of internet traffic currently, and is expected to grow to 80% by 2020.)<\/p>\n<p>As marketers, video is powerful not only to help engage our audience, but also to help us learn about them. You can tell a lot about what your audience is interested in by how long they watch a video. We can use this content to gage engagement with a particular idea or subject. Conversation is the most natural form of communication for humans, and video is the closest form of content to conversation. It&#8217;s more immersive than email marketing or text posts. Using video to demonstrate a product, action or idea can help you communicate more clearly with your audience, which in turn helps drive action.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Katie Wagner<\/strong> &#8211; President at <a href=\"https:\/\/katiewagnersocialmedia.com\/\">Katie Wagner Social Media<\/a>, a digital marketing agency made up of journalists, specialized in content creation &amp; social media management<\/p>\n<p>Also find her on Twitter at <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SocialMediaPuma\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/SocialMediaPuma<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/separator.png\" alt=\"separator\" width=\"426\" height=\"118\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3183\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/separator.png 426w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/separator-300x83.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3158\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Chelsea-C-runs-paperroute.jpg\" alt=\"Chelsea C - runs paperroute\" width=\"300\" height=\"230\" \/>Video is very important for social media marketing now more than ever.

If our brands don&#8217;t understand the language (the tools used to record or go live, the platforms in which we share this video content) we will be left standing on the outside of all conversations. Everyone is talking about it. Everyone knows that video content is being shared more, consumed more, and preferred by all social platforms, but still few are actually taking action.<\/p>\n<p>The big question is, &#8220;WHY?&#8221; Why are so few brands actually using video content? It could be the desire for perfection. Waiting on acquiring the right equipment and finding the right scriptwriters and the right actors or talent to be on video. Live video is out of the question for the perfection-seekers since there are just so many areas where things can go terribly IMPERFECT!<\/p>\n<p>Some might be paralyzed by their lack of knowledge in using today&#8217;s video content platforms. Facebook Live, Instagram Live, Twitter Live, YouTube Live and LinkedIn video sharing are just a few being used today.<\/p>\n<p>The key to getting really good at using video content in 2018 is to simply START. Don&#8217;t wait. Don&#8217;t script. Just jot down your top FAQs and then hit that red record button and answer one question at a time.<\/p>\n<p>You can&#8217;t get great until you get started!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gina Schreck<\/strong> &#8211; CEO at <a href=\"http:\/\/socialknx.com\/\">SocialKNX<\/a> a content marketing &amp; social media management agency<\/p>\n<p>Follow her on Twitter at <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Ginaschreck\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/Ginaschreck<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/separator.png\" alt=\"separator\" width=\"426\" height=\"118\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3183\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/separator.png 426w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/separator-300x83.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3161\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Corina-Ramos-Wordpress-web-designer-and-virtual-service-provider.jpg\" alt=\"Corina Ramos - WordPress web designer and virtual service provider\" width=\"300\" height=\"230\" \/>If you want your business to succeed in 2018 you have to include video in your social media marketing plan.

Sherman is an experienced social media strategist\" width=\"300\" height=\"230\" \/>Video content has by far the largest share in the content mix for strategies I am writing in 2018. Facebook&#8217;s investment into video alone speaks to the importance of brands focusing their efforts on high-quality video content over the next year. It&#8217;s also important to note what type of video content is outperforming the rest. Social media networks are above and beyond promoting videos that are natively shared to their networks over videos that are shared via a YouTube link. This completely changes the way brands think about video production. Now, instead of creating longer YouTube videos, it&#8217;s critical to create videos under the networks&#8217; max amount of time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Marji J.

That being said, many B2B companies have chosen to use video simply as a platform to disseminate product features and competitor comparisons. What a wasted opportunity!<\/p>\n<p>Instead of this tired, outdated approach, B2B organizations should take a cue from B2C marketers and produce videos that actually tell stories that reinforce the brand. Video storytelling is such a powerful way to create an emotional connection with a brand that it\u2019s a must for any organization hoping to resonate with its target audience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Drew Neisser<\/strong>, Founder &amp; CEO \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/renegade.com\/\">Renegade<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Find him on Twitter at <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DrewNeisser\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/DrewNeisser<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/separator.png\" alt=\"separator\" width=\"426\" height=\"118\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3183\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/separator.png 426w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/separator-300x83.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3171\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Shama-Hyder-is-a-visionary-strategist-for-the-digital-age.jpg\" alt=\"Shama Hyder is a visionary strategist for the digital age\" width=\"300\" height=\"230\" \/>It\u2019s no secret that people love videos. Whether we\u2019re trying to learn a new skill or simply amuse ourselves with funny cat shenanigans, we gravitate towards video content. There\u2019s an immediacy and conversational nature to video that allows us to grasp complex ideas and feel a sense of connection. We\u2019re no different as consumers. When we\u2019re considering a product or interacting with a brand, video content draws us in, and when video is combined with powerful storytelling, the result opens our hearts and minds, not to mention wallets.<\/p>\n<p>The growing use of mobile devices by young and old alike \u2014 to browse, socialize, and shop \u2014 and the resulting saturated news feeds and strained attention spans are equal contributors to the popularity of video.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, in 2017, online video accounted for 74% of all online traffic.<\/p>\n<p>Impressed?<\/p>\n<p>You should also know:<\/p>\n<p>Four times as many consumers would prefer to watch a video about a product than to read about it, and using the word \u201cvideo\u201d in an email subject line boosts open rates by 19% and click-through rates by 65%.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, it\u2019s not just about the statistics.
