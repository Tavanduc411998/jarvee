The best way to get to know your audience, in my opinion, is by gathering data about them, and if its in the form of giveaways, polls, or competitions, then you&#039;ll have a very big database assuming you have a large audience.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the article Jarvee! 

I just wanted to say that THANK you for pointing out to people that their social media content strategy should align with their GENERAL content strategy. 

Many people treat their content strategy for social media in a completely different way. The only thing that should be different, as you pointed out, is the TYPE of content we post on different platforms.]]></description>
