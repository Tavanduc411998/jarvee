Today, people from different backgrounds and ages have resorted to platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook to sustain connections and also build new networks.<\/p>\n<p>It is also easier to communicate your professional skills such as <a href=\"https:\/\/craftresumes.com\/cvwriting\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CraftResumes<\/a> and career journey through social media. Therefore, it is very critical for any job seeker to learn how to use these platforms in the current age. Remember that even the hiring managers have adopted social media as a way to enhance the process because it is quicker with minimal constraints.<\/p>\n<p>Below are some reasons that highlight why you to embrace social media as a path to your career:<\/p>\n<h2>Social media provides more information beyond the resume<\/h2>\n<p>Recruiting managers are now using individual social media profiles for potential employees to identify their true characters and how they conduct themselves. Some of this information may not be listed on the resumes because of its sensitivity. Since the market is so competitive, employers are going for the best. Among the ways to uncover the characters of the prospective employees is to peruse social media accounts. Aspects of personality such as anger and compassion are clearly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.resumehelp.com\/resources\/articles\/technology\/why-social-media-is-more-important-than-ever-for-job-seekers\">expressed in one&#8217;s posts<\/a> and responses towards other users. You may be tempted to imagine that employers are just looking for the academic qualifications on the LinkedIn profile, but this is wrong.<\/p>\n<h2>Learning about companies<\/h2>\n<p>Social media is a two-way platform that benefits both the job seeker and the hiring personnel. In the case of the job seeker, you can use all the platforms to perform your homework about the company that you wish to join. In this way, you will get an idea of the job vacancies, local community and the corporate culture of the various companies. In case you are not interested in any of the factors about it, you could decline the job offer or fail to apply. If you choose to make the application, the information gathered will give you an edge above other applicants during the interview session.<\/p>\n<h2>Indication of Cultural Fit<\/h2>\n<p>As you aspire to join an organisation, there are particular aspects of culture that you need to understand. Apart from your credentials in the academic sphere, many employers would like to ascertain whether you will <a href=\"https:\/\/www.revelian.com\/employer\/blog\/can-social-media-profiles-tell-us-cultural-fit\/\">fit into the culture of the company<\/a>. There is no other way other than the analysis on social media platforms, regarding the values that you stand for.<\/p>\n<p>Besides, the employer would like to establish whether you have taken part in useful activities like community development. If you have listed them in your profile, you may be hired because you exhibit positive traits like leadership and management. In case there are too many applications, social media can also disadvantage you if you have misused it. The recruiters will be left with this as criteria to thin down on the number they wish to hire.<\/p>\n<h2>Learning New Insights<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Learning-New-Insights.jpg\" alt=\"Learning New Insights\" width=\"602\" height=\"401\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7028\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Learning-New-Insights.jpg 602w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Learning-New-Insights-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Learning-New-Insights-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Given that social media has attracted almost all individuals in many careers, it is a rich platform where you can get the greatest insights out of the connections that you create. For instance, you can get into various groups where members share trends and activities that are taking place across the corporate world. This is a perfect chance to learn and make a decision about what you need in life and the specific career that you should chase. Career development is not a preserve of an individual. Social media groups have individuals working in various companies, and they have the requisite expertise to help you in a particular career path.<\/p>\n<h2>Building Your Brand<\/h2>\n<p>For job seekers who are interested in particular careers, social media comes in as the best platform where they can build and enhance their brands. Assuming you want to be a doctor, you can create a profile that only bears information about medication and the procedures of patient care. This is crucial because a simple click on a profile will inform the employer of the individual that they wish to hire. Your career profile will also attract interested parties in your field to contribute towards enriching your career. Fellow doctors will invite you to their pages so that you share more information. This is applicable to all other careers.<\/p>\n<h2>Social media for advertisement of job vacancies<\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes it can be too expensive to place adverts in mainstream media houses to reach a large pool of applicants. Instead, companies have found reprieve in various social media platforms, including Google+ and Facebook. Here, they can attract a larger group without necessarily paying hefty sums of money. The only cost they incur is the internet, which is rather negligible because the advert is done in a simple click. On the other hand, job seekers can <a href=\"https:\/\/jobs.theguardian.com\/article\/how-to-use-social-media-in-your-job-search\/\">learn about job postings<\/a> without necessarily buying a newspaper or going through the hassle of subscribing for a particular TV program. With the presence of mobile phones, all details can be retrieved in seconds.<\/p>\n<h2>Visual Applications<\/h2>\n<p>In the past, job seekers could only give written applications to managers, which are often insufficient. Social media has provided a platform where the applicant can back up the information on the resume using photographs of previous engagements in other companies. Pictorial evidence is more trustworthy because it reveals the experience that an employee has had while working for the companies before. However, in your application, you should select more professional photos that are clear. Photos that bear informal content can sabotage your prospects of landing your dream job.<\/p>\n<h2>Locating of Articles and Magazines<\/h2>\n<p>Many authors are using social media as an outlet for their content. It would be best if you watched out for the articles that talk about careers because they are availed free of charge. The owners of the articles simply provide links for you to visit their sites and build traffic. Grab the opportunity to broaden your scope on the various career opportunities. Do not forget that careers are available even on the online platforms, and these write-ups will lead you to some of them. As you read the articles, take some notes of the companies listed so that you research about them and contact them in case they have any vacancies.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>No doubt that social media is transforming the career world, and you should be alert to this fact. Individuals across all ages are embracing this technology to change their livelihoods by tracking down jobs of their dreams. The employers are on the watch out to use the platforms to study your characters as well. Therefore, be diligent as you interact with other users. Take note of the fact that some rogue users are using social media to advance their ulterior motives, including cyberbullying. Do not pay attention to them because they will only compromise your chances of landing a good job.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the author<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Laura Garber is a social media expert who specializes in helping her clients to maximize their social media platforms and build a recognizable and trusted brand.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There is every indication that social media has taken over many aspects of life, and the development of careers is no exception.
