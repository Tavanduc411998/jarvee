But if the COVID-19 experience is anything to go by, you already know that change is often unpredictable.<\/p>\n<p>Notwithstanding, content marketing research has shown us different factors to consider. For example, consumer behavior will now favor personalization and automation in 2021.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s dive right in to discover top emerging content marketing trends every content marketer can boldly implement today.<\/p>\n<h2>Live events<\/h2>\n<p>With the \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2020\/may\/21\/the-zoom-boom-how-video-calling-became-a-blessing-and-a-curse\">Zoom boom<\/a>\u2019 over the past year, marketing agencies now have to adopt video events to promote their content.<\/p>\n<p>Webinars, live streams, and meetups provide an opportunity to address complex concepts in simple terms. Modern consumers crave value-laden digestible content. So, you can garner their attention with informative live streams.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, podcasts are becoming extremely popular. Apart from the informative nature of podcasting, it offers an interactive platform for the exchange of ideas.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, companies will now use podcasts and webinars to increase content engagement and conversion.<\/p>\n<h2>AI-powered initiatives<\/h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smallbizdaily.com\/will-ai-take-over-the-marketing-world-2020\/\">AI takeover<\/a> has been around the corner, but it became more evident over the pasten10 months.<\/p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence can now improve content marketing strategies by analyzing impact and engagement. Some machine learning tools like Ahrefs can analyze websites for keyword SEO and user experience.<\/p>\n<p>Due to this looming AI dominance, experts are concerned that automated tasks would eliminate the human factor. However, robots can only perform pre-programmed tasks tailored to specific instructions and data input. As a result, your business still needs an online essay writer to create written content, even if you have advanced tools. This is the only way to make your content sound less robotic.<\/p>\n<h2>Multichannel marketing<\/h2>\n<p>If your business is putting out engaging content at a high clip rate, repurposing will help you increase your reach.<\/p>\n<p>Hire a cheap essay writer to create an informative blog post. Afterward, you can repurpose the content to share on multiple platforms and attract a different audience.<\/p>\n<p>Here are ways to repackage content:<\/p>\n<p>\u2981 Convert your blog posts into eBooks and periodical newsletters.<br \/>\n\u2981 Add video links to your blog.<br \/>\n\u2981 Convert your video content to written posts.<br \/>\n\u2981 Convert written content to podcasts and webinars.<br \/>\n\u2981 Break down the data into infographics.<\/p>\n<h2>Template revolution<\/h2>\n<p>In most companies, the content creation workflow is repetitive, leading to inefficient time management. In light of this problem, templates will experience a massive boom in sales over the coming months.<\/p>\n<p>Companies can reduce the time spent on tasks by creating templates for recurring content formats. Instead of making your college essay writers create and format everything from scratch, they can save time by using templates for the entire marketing campaign.<\/p>\n<h2>Voice search SEO<\/h2>\n<p>AI-powered solutions like <a href=\"https:\/\/wordlift.io\/blog\/en\/entity\/google-voice\/\">Google Voice Search<\/a> will shake up SEO in 2021. In the past, people relied on voice-activated assistants to perform tasks at home. But today, voice search has become a thing since over 50% of online searches are done vocally.<\/p>\n<p>Businesses now need to optimize their content for voice search. Unlike organic searches, voice search has a conversational feel to it. Therefore, use Google\u2019s search optimization recommendations to increase your content\u2019s exposure.<\/p>\n<p>Also, provide answers to frequently asked questions and stand a chance to get your content to the featured snippet.<\/p>\n<h2>Content authority over keyword SEO<\/h2>\n<p>According to recent Google Indexing rules, content authority is now a significant factor ahead of keyword SEO.<\/p>\n<p>Notwithstanding, your content still needs keyword SEO to climb the rankings. But only posts from experts can boost your content to the top.<\/p>\n<p>A Nielsen study shows that 85% of consumers prioritize expertise and authoritativeness. In essence, a post from Stephen King on writing will get more attention than an informative article from a relatively unknown writer.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, combine SEO strategies with authoritativeness by focusing on guest posts from industry experts.<\/p>\n<h2>Emphasis on user experience<\/h2>\n<p>Content marketing now focuses on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.singlegrain.com\/blog-posts\/content-marketing\/7-ux-lessons-apply-content-campaigns\/?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=876c136d9b539a92236cfba2ccbfb8a246cf88c5-1618478835-0-AVmh9Z76r6iFbgxQ_6MQZbllQ08I_O-3pJPsC20VOIgzuHNCe_4EKnBCQuD-INHNQ5QjGGhpFaAmg2GjXMxOaCa5BnkIggcZOmDhqP67D5N2gH_l66yi77wpnkIYpn6lWzgkVvJ6VmrXcHBRXhJ54k97Odgn78d3dSRYNrJv6H3D9K1rDGeu6F-yUa-AM9UJIIAiuQ75gnXfWAxVfH_c1XOC0Mj-Ge6zSCZi1hC9xqCE3sYoge5jn5mGuAy7JNPF4l5LxP1STunEq_PUwENU5KplCv2l9khycpEbFvg_2CmVn-dfSn17oq8BlD5Rrq2-C2WfdovarAsuEv0XoyUs1cfa0c8dji5gcaYfn_uZrmfgU9vTxaRkEsB-sKnoeFlRSUgt3AdPvnOEKzerGaCmY2SNWOic4XS19421HO-Y_k1HpmNICXNMJ_GMlZUJ-UnLGvKPfg9Q06EmpehaOR2o6aXV2WvGgIXV7lUhXam6d4Ab_4OIuYFIh2XhNbAdroNT-I8bkIpx9PPIdK-6_ruHA-oY--cQXEohcVkJVMDRGxkwDsgvttC8HsMl9yAWcCXPLILn0cKq1D5TcUhH789D60xwpbF7G03Pe6Ndznxjj9vhJuA2j0_7oG2bszMhJ3MGVtsmB7l32rsTfedHlItfH18MNeUy69CB6xIx7oVSItOx\">user experience<\/a>. It is not about what you can offer the consumer but how you deliver it. If your website is difficult to use on desktop and mobile, its bounce rate will increase, affecting the ranking.<\/p>\n<p>Besides, Google bots now prioritize the user experience in rankings. Web crawlers now focus on the site\u2019s UX design, load time, and responsiveness. And a lot of attention falls on mobile UX because most online traffic comes from mobile devices.\u00a0 \u00a0A professional <a href=\"https:\/\/clay.global\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UX design firm<\/a> like Clay.Global should be able to help you transform your website into one that is optimized for both desktop and mobile users.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8810 \" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/content-personalization-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"654\" height=\"436\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/content-personalization-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/content-personalization-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/content-personalization-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/content-personalization-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/content-personalization-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/content-personalization.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Content personalization<\/h2>\n<p>As part of the effort to improve user experience, content marketing now relies on personalization to stay competitive.<\/p>\n<p>Modern consumers want to feel that personal connection with a brand rather than appear as just another stat on a screen. Salesforce\u2019s \u201cState of the Connected Consumer\u201d shows that 80% of consumers only use brands that address their needs.<\/p>\n<p>But how can a company customize content across the board?<\/p>\n<p>First of all, personalize it to your audience\u2019s demographic instead of creating generic content. Use surveys and other customer engagement platforms to gather valuable insights into consumer behavior.<\/p>\n<h2>Content communities<\/h2>\n<p>Considering the radical shift to the virtual space in 2020, it is no surprise that content communities are popping up everywhere. Companies now focus their customer retention strategies on community building.<\/p>\n<p>But for the content community to thrive amidst fierce competition, you must establish trust and loyalty with your audience. Otherwise, your consumers will look for lucrative alternatives.<\/p>\n<p>Activities like online discussions, virtual meetups, and webinars foster this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.softr.io\/online-community\">online community<\/a>. You can also create a subscriber community for your email contact. This sense of exclusivity shows your customers that they are valued assets in the content creation and marketing cycle.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Staying ahead of <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/top-6-content-marketing-strategies-and-trends-for-2021\/\">content marketing trends<\/a> will give your business a massive competitive advantage.
