You don&#8217;t need a degree for it; most of them don&#8217;t even have a certification or a diploma relevant to it. They simply walk their followers through their Instagram account and influence millions of lives by sharing their experiences and day to day life.<\/p>\n<p>The weird thing is that we don&#8217;t even know the real name of the influencers or life coaches that we are following on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.founderjar.com\/social-media-marketing-statistics\/\">social media<\/a>, but we are aware of small details like their favorite coffee mug, their laundry routine, their favorite color, and the list goes on and on. <\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s weirder how one day we feel like we associate with them, and following up with their stories becomes part of our routine. But, what attracts us to their social media? Is it their aesthetically displayed pictures, or are they actually bringing across a message that we all enjoy looking forward to? <\/p>\n<p>There is one thing common in what we refer to as Instagrammers, Influencers, or Life Coaches. They are incredibly confident. What is even more attractive is how they are displaying even the simplest everyday activities in an inspiring way. Such acts inspire others to lead their &#8220;simple&#8221; lives happily and be more content.<br \/>\nHowever, along the way, a lot of us lose track of what is actually inspiring us and making us stick around. Is it to have a balanced life ourselves or the life of a life coach? Another question that a lot of us ask while scrolling through posts that are related to life coaches is whether we need one ourselves? Does life coaching works, or is it just an easy fix? Let&#8217;s find out below!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/social-media-life-coach-.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"820\" height=\"547\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7577\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/social-media-life-coach-.jpg 820w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/social-media-life-coach--300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/social-media-life-coach--768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/social-media-life-coach--600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Is Instagram Life Coaching a Solution?<\/h3>\n<p>For most of us, hiring a Life Coach is probably not the first solution we have to problems in our lives. It could be because of financial issues or simply because we don&#8217;t have the energy to make such changes in our lives dictated by someone else. However, the rise of Instagram coaches has made it affordable to reach out to people who are willing to give coaching at lower rates. This has somewhat made life coaching more common and more acceptable too. <\/p>\n<p>Since coaching is relatively a new concept, there are several misconceptions regarding it. The most common one being is that life coaching is just like counseling. Let&#8217;s clear this one out first \u2013 counselors require years of training before they are in a position to counsel patients. Life coaching is different; as we discussed before, life coaching does not require a professional degree or certification. Most life coaches on Instagram are doing things based on their own life experiences. The concept is very similar to that of influencers and vloggers. They share their own lives to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/marcel-schwantes\/3-inspiring-habits-of-most-influential-bosses-youll-actually-see-in-2018.html\">influence and inspire people<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>There are some great life coaches out there who are changing people&#8217;s lives and creating a positive impact too. The surge in the number of life coaches on social media can be due to more people who are working on themselves and wish to share their own life experiences for the betterment of other people. To a certain extent, this works too and helps to motivate people as they can see results. But for people who are not able to relate, it might not be a promising solution. Whenever you are about to hire a life coach, don&#8217;t hesitate to ask them questions like how much have they trained? Do they have the relevant qualifications? How much are they aware, are they of professional boundaries? Such questions will help you make your decision in a better way.<\/p>\n<h3>When Does Life Coaching Go Wrong?<\/h3>\n<p>Since most life coaches on social media have not undergone professional training regarding this field, they are not aware of the professional boundaries that they need to develop with their clients. They end up intruding too much into the client&#8217;s psyche. Something they might not be ready for and might lead to deeper emotional trauma. Therefore, find a life coach who is accredited. <\/p>\n<p>This again might be an issue since it is not a formal requirement, and for most people who call themselves, a coach simply has to change their bio and add a few motivational quotes on their feed. Such coaches might end up misleading people more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.successconsciousness.com\/blog\/tips-for-life\/how-to-take-charge-of-your-life\/\">helping them take charge of their lives<\/a>. On the flip side, many have felt a real change in their lives once they found themselves linked with a life coach. Life coaches made them see things differently and made them more confident about their own abilities. <\/p>\n<p>One thing is clear, though \u2013 giving oneself the time and energy to reflect on one&#8217;s own behavior can alone have major benefits on a person&#8217;s life. It can entirely change their perspective. But this does make us think of it from another perspective \u2013 if the purpose of a life coach was actually to develop a realization, then couldn&#8217;t people develop it on their own? Probably yes, but a life coached helps people see things more clearly.<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/instagram-life-coach.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"820\" height=\"615\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7578\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/instagram-life-coach.jpg 820w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/instagram-life-coach-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/instagram-life-coach-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/instagram-life-coach-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Key Takeaways<\/h3>\n<p>The concept of life coaching does seem tempting for a lot of people. Think of it this way \u2013 having the chance to sort your life through a few Skype calls \u2013 all one needs is a router and coaxial cable. Is it that simple?! The concept is both an exciting and tempting concept. But then again, this not something that you could expect from a random person on the internet, or could you? The solution to your problems could be just a DM away? Sounds ideal, no?<br \/>\nRegardless of the pros and cons of hiring a life coach, let&#8217;s look at it this way. Life coaching enables hundreds of women to support and train other women, teenagers, and men too. It could be possible that life coaching is doing more good than harm. It would be, however, safer if one does their research before hiring someone to help them straighten their lives. <\/p>\n<h4>Author Bio<\/h4>\n<p><b>Nouman<\/b> provides ghostwriting and copywriting services.
