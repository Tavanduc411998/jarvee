Moreover, it&#8217;s a stimulating type of content that can instantly capture your audience&#8217;s attention.<\/p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s not surprising (<em>or uncommon<\/em>) to see social media users engaging far more with live-action and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yumyumvideos.com\/top-10-animation-companies\/\">animated videos<\/a> than with other kinds of posts &#8211; which leads to more and more businesses trying to add this powerful resource into their social strategy\u2026 <em>and failing<\/em>.

Apart from YouTube (<em>and sometimes Facebook, to a lesser degree<\/em>), where users expect and enjoy longer content, the <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/which-social-channels-should-i-focus-on-there-are-just-so-many\/\">most popular social networks<\/a> favor short videos. Many of their users are on the go or just looking for a small distraction from their daily lives, so they aren\u2019t willing to spend too much time on a <em>single<\/em> video.<\/p>\n<p>With this in mind, we strongly recommend you to keep your social videos <strong>below the 3-minute mark<\/strong>. But, as you know, every social platform is a world of its own, so let\u2019s get a bit more specific:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To be entirely watched on feed,<strong> Instagram videos<\/strong> should be less than a minute long.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Twitter videos<\/strong> ought to be under 30 seconds. That was their original limit length, so users are most used to it.<\/li>\n<li>Each <strong>TikTok video<\/strong> can last 15 seconds at most, but you can join up to 4 of them to create 1-minute pieces.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Facebook\u2019s case<\/strong> it&#8217;s a bit more complicated. Their users engage more with 2-minute videos or less, but their algorithm favors those that last at least 3 minutes. It&#8217;s up to you to decide whether to increase your engagement rate or your visibility.<\/p>\n<h2>Go with Evergreen Topics<\/h2>\n<p>As established earlier, social media thrives on fast content, and you know what they say: <em>live fast, die young<\/em>. That seems to be the rule on social media, where an incredibly viral topic gets totally forgotten from one day to the other. In such a changing context, it\u2019s hard to know what to post.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, trending topics are a natural choice. People are dying to talk about the last celebrity scandal and whatever Trump has twitted. Still, before you jump into that conversation, you need to stop and think: <em>Is it related to your brand? Does it match with your target audience&#8217;s interests?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Besides, professional video production can take some time. When it&#8217;s finally over, the trending topic in question may be in its dying stage.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s better to use video content to <strong>cover evergreen <\/strong>\u2013 <em>or at least lasting<\/em> \u2013<strong> topics<\/strong>. Think about those high-quality pieces that offer practical or educational value, like How-tos or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yumyumvideos.com\/top-5-whiteboard-animation-companies\/\">whiteboard videos<\/a>. Or those that are highly entertaining, thought-provoking, or simply beautiful.<\/p>\n<p>The only problem with everlasting topics is that they might have been covered before. It&#8217;s vital to create new conversations around them by producing videos with a <strong>fresh and original approach<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/producing-videos-with-a-fresh-and-original-approach.png\" alt=\"producing videos with a fresh and original approach\" width=\"567\" height=\"319\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7475\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/producing-videos-with-a-fresh-and-original-approach.png 567w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/producing-videos-with-a-fresh-and-original-approach-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Start with the Right Foot<\/h2>\n<p>As most social platforms let videos autoplay on feed, viewers get to watch the first few seconds of your piece before they finish scrolling over your post. This is a golden opportunity to catch your audience&#8217;s eyes.<\/p>\n<p>Pay special attention to <strong>the beginning of your video <\/strong>and make it as engaging as possible. For instance, you can make an intriguing statement or ask a direct question to <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/top-10-expert-tips-on-researching-your-target-audience\/\">your target audience<\/a>. Even better if that question resonates with them and leads the conversation towards your products or services.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also possible to open your video with a bizarre image or situation. In fact, it\u2019s common to find pieces that preview a tiny, intriguing future fragment of the video at the very beginning to pique viewers\u2019 curiosity. That said, sometimes there\u2019s no need to be mysterious to call the attention \u2013 sometimes, all it takes is to be direct.<\/p>\n<p>To start your video with the right foot, avoid beating around the bush and <strong>go straight to the point<\/strong>. This practice can also help you make your video short and sweet, killing two birds with one stone.<\/p>\n<p>If you are lucky \u2013 sorry, more like, <em>if you play your cards right<\/em> \u2013 you&#8217;ll get new viewers, and should aim at holding their attention throughout the rest of the piece.<\/p>\n<h2>Optimize your Videos\u2019 Copy<\/h2>\n<p>Yes, videos beat written content on social media. However, don&#8217;t let that fool you into thinking people will skip your video&#8217;s copy. They might read it to know what the piece is about, or they may even glance it over without noticing! Whatever the case, you can seize this chance to drive views and engagement by <strong>writing an alluring copy<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>This copy should match with your video&#8217;s style and hint something about its content.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine, for instance, a text that says, &#8220;<em>He didn\u2019t see that coming<\/em> &#x1f602;.&#8221; You have seen no video, and yet, I bet you pictured a humorous piece with a funny element of surprise.<\/p>\n<p>That last word is also highly important when it comes to video copies \u2013 <em>surprise<\/em>. Notice that the text example gives clues about the piece,<em> without spoiling it. <\/em>Your copy shouldn&#8217;t work as your video&#8217;s replacement but as its <strong>complement<\/strong>. So, avoid summarizing the entire piece and focus on writing <strong>additional information<\/strong> that may attract or interest the viewer.<\/p>\n<p>The copy is also a great place to <strong>start a conversation with your audience<\/strong>. Why don&#8217;t you ask them their thoughts on the video&#8217;s topic? Or encourage them to talk about their own experiences?<\/p>\n<p>Prompting viewers to leave a comment can not only put your post in the algorithm&#8217;s good books, but it also helps you to form a closer relationship with your audience. They can feel appreciated \u2013 especially if you answer their comments \u2013 and that could be the start of a lasting, loyal relationship with your brand.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/loyal-relationship-with-your-brand.png\" alt=\"loyal relationship with your brand\" width=\"567\" height=\"319\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7476\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/loyal-relationship-with-your-brand.png 567w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/loyal-relationship-with-your-brand-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Include Captions and Subtitles<\/h2>\n<p>This may seem like a minor detail to take care of, but you&#8217;d be surprised by its potential to enhance the user&#8217;s experience.<\/p>\n<p>Needless to say, adding captions or subtitles that include the entirety of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.veedyou.com\/video-script\/\">video\u2019s script<\/a> can <strong>make it accessible<\/strong> to viewers with hearing impairments and to foreigners with a different mother tongue. That said, this practice not only benefits minorities, but it also helps a vast amount of people.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s right! Most social users prefer to <strong>watch videos with the sound off <\/strong>when they are <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/9-ways-optimize-social-media-posts-mobile\/\">in public spaces<\/a> or means of transports. Reading captions or subtitles allows them to understand what the video is about without bothering the rest of the crowd or putting their headphones on.<\/p>\n<p>As an extra benefit, people are more likely to watch videos with captions until the very end. Not bad, huh?<\/p>\n<h2>Wrapping Up<\/h2>\n<p>Even something as simple as uploading a video requires a thought-out plan and an eye for detail in the social marketing world.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s vital, for example, to make your video as accessible and user-friendly as possible by leveraging helpful techniques, like using captions. Equally important is to draw eyes to your piece, which can be accomplished with a compelling copy and an attractive video introduction.<\/p>\n<p>Do you see? Posting a successful video is not that simple, but it&#8217;s not hard, either! You just need to have all these handy strategies in mind.
