Otherwise, it is as good as non-existent. This is why, app marketing pre and post launch plays such a significant role. Not only you need to build audience for your upcoming app, you also need them to convert when it does become available.<\/p>\n<p>In short, there is a lot of work cut out for mobile apps. A lot of the time, businesses hire a professional mobile app development company in Dallas to get a great app with best features. However, they mistake a well-built app to be their ticket to high return on investments and conversions. This is where everything goes downhill.<\/p>\n<p>So, what can these companies do to make sure their mobile app is acquired, downloaded, and used actively? We have compiled a list of top app marketing strategies that business can leverage.<\/p>\n<p>So let us begin.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Build an App Landing Page <\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Build-an-App-Landing-Page.jpg\" alt=\"Build an App Landing Page \" width=\"654\" height=\"459\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7227\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Build-an-App-Landing-Page.jpg 654w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Build-an-App-Landing-Page-300x211.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Build-an-App-Landing-Page-600x421.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Web pages assist mobile apps with the necessary reach and visibility they require. Since at the end of the day, mobile apps can expand their reach within the app stores only. This is why make sure you have a landing page for your app.<\/p>\n<p>Consider this landing page as the introduction of your mobile app. So, what should it include?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strong introduction about your app (what it is about, what problem it solves, and more).<\/li>\n<li>There should be high-quality pictures of the user interface.<\/li>\n<li>A precise yet engaging introduction to the core features.<\/li>\n<li>A small promotional video explains everything including how user-friendly it is, will be a bonus.<\/li>\n<li>LASTLY, but most importantly, don\u2019t forget to add a call-to-action button that is for downloading your app.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure the overall web page design is clean, slick, and minimal with major focuses on the important aspects of your mobile app.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Another great benefit that you reap from your web page is the chance to rank on search engines. So, if you end up ranking on the keywords related to your app, you can get a decent amount of visibility and <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-proper-keyword-research-can-skyrocket-your-social-media-traffic\/\">traffic<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Invest in Eye-Catching Videos <\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Invest-in-Eye-Catching-Videos.jpg\" alt=\"Invest in Eye-Catching Videos \" width=\"673\" height=\"352\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7228\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Invest-in-Eye-Catching-Videos.jpg 673w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Invest-in-Eye-Catching-Videos-300x157.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Invest-in-Eye-Catching-Videos-600x314.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Any social media user can vouch for videos being a more engaging platform; especially short videos. Not only the human eye is more receptive to moving shots, it is more likely to be the only platform maintaining their attention. Not believable? Video content accounts for nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/clevertap.com\/blog\/mobile-marketing-trends-and-influencers-2018\/\">80% of all consumer internet traffic<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So, it is best to leverage this into your app marketing campaigns. Hire an uber-professional and creative designer and have them make a shirt 60-second video promoting your app. Make sure there is enough text and self-explanatory shots for the video to be understood without voice as well.<\/p>\n<p>Another point to keep in mind is the accessibility factor; creating a promotional video that everyone, regardless of any inability can understand. It is 2020, and we should embrace inclusivity.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Focus on App Store Optimization (ASO)<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Focus-on-App-Store-Optimization-ASO.jpg\" alt=\"Focus on App Store Optimization (ASO)\" width=\"730\" height=\"384\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7229\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Focus-on-App-Store-Optimization-ASO.jpg 730w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Focus-on-App-Store-Optimization-ASO-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Focus-on-App-Store-Optimization-ASO-600x316.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Just like search engine optimization for your landing page, your mobile app should be app store optimized for better visibility within the store.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re lucky and your ASO is on the mark, your app may just land in the top chart section. Of course, there are many layers to ASO and it should be dealt with thoroughly.<\/p>\n<p>So, what are you gaining exactly through ASO?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increases visibility in search.<\/li>\n<li>Get discovered by relevant users.<\/li>\n<li>Boosts organic downloads.<\/li>\n<li>Gain competitive edge.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>4.Be Active on Social Media <\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Be-Active-on-Social-Media.jpg\" alt=\"Be Active on Social Media \" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7230\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Be-Active-on-Social-Media.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Be-Active-on-Social-Media-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>By saying to stay active on social media does not mean to make an account on every social media platform. You need to do audience research and see where your <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/top-10-expert-tips-on-researching-your-target-audience\/\">target audience<\/a> largely resides.<\/p>\n<p>Once those platforms, let\u2019s say Facebook, Twitter, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/\">Instagram<\/a>, are identified; then you need to study what kind of campaigns and posts work best on each one of them. Yes, who wouldn\u2019t like to create one post and hit submit on all of them. However, you need to understand that the post that may be engaging for Facebook audience may not be that popular with Instagrammers.<\/p>\n<p>All in all, social media is an integral part of any brand\u2019s marketing strategy. After all, these are the main platforms that drive digital marketing. So make sure you are engaging with your audience and nurturing leads on social networks.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Reach Out to Influencers <\/h2>\n<p>It is the rise of bloggers and influencers that have massive followers on their social accounts. They are heard, engaged with, and followed like idols. Hence, if you are reaching out to one of the big fishes that happen to have relevant audience for your app; you will be charged a hefty fee for an app review\/promotion\/feature.<\/p>\n<p>However, as long as they have the right target audience, it is worth it. How? Because your software product is getting promoted to a couple of thousand followers. That is more visibility for your app and possible conversions.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a win-win situation!<\/p>\n<h2>6. Start a Blog <\/h2>\n<p>Blogs are a great way to drive relevant traffic, nurture those leads through relevant and interesting content, and hopefully result in conversions.<\/p>\n<p>Like the landing page we discussed, your blog can also rank on search engine and boost your blog\u2019s visibility. As for the content, it could be about the journey of your mobile app. You can also share updates, news, and any contest or giveaway. Moreover, you can talk about the many ways your app proves to be useful.<\/p>\n<p>Really, with blogging, there is so much room for creativity and content creation. As long as it is relevant to your mobile app and the industry, it is best to post regularly.<\/p>\n<p>Businesses that blog generate <a href=\"https:\/\/blogging.com\/statistics\/\">126% more leads<\/a> than the ones that don\u2019t bother with one. So, do not miss out on this chance.<\/p>\n<h2>Wrapping Up <\/h2>\n<p>Mobile app marketing is a process that should start from the beginning of your mobile app journey. Considering how competitive and saturated mobile app marketplace has become, it has become harder to stand out from the crowd.<\/p>\n<p>There are so many businesses that suffer from app abonnement or zero downloads after a successful launch. This is why, your marketing team should be on its toes with the best strategies in order to make the most of available platforms.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the author<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Zubair is a digital enthusiast who loves to write on various trends, including Tech, Software Development, AI, and Personal Development.
