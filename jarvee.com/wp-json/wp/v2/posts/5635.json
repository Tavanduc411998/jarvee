And that trend is not stopping any time soon.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to start using IGTV as a sales or marketing channel for your business you are already on the right track for success.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re like me when I started out though, you probably don\u2019t really know where to go about it the best way. That\u2019s totally fine! Every Instagram superstar has been there in the very beginning.<\/p>\n<p>After working on hundreds of video editing jobs with my clients over the past couple of years, I think I\u2019m okay to say I figured out what works and what doesn\u2019t on IGTV.<\/p>\n<p>So whether you are a one-man show business and take care of everything yourself or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.veedyou.com\/outsource-video-editing\/\">outsource video editing<\/a> to scale up your video marketing efforts, at the end of the day you want to put out videos that convert.<\/p>\n<p>So, in this post, I am going to break down by 5 best tips that will give you a head start with your Instagram videos. Let\u2019s dive in.<\/p>\n<h2>Tip #1 Always go vertical<\/h2>\n<p>Many old-school video content creators, myself included, love those nice, wide, horizontal, cinematic-looking videos. I am totally guilty of that as well.<\/p>\n<p>Even though Instagram lets you upload 16:9 videos, you will get much better results when you\u2019re using vertical videos. Or at least a square 1:1 aspect ratio for your videos. Those aspect ratios will get you the most engagement, <a href=\"https:\/\/workmacro.com\/instagram\/perfect-aspect-ratio-instagram-photos\/\">as per studies<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Sure, you can just take a 16:9 and crop the sides. That works, but it\u2019s not the optimal way to do it. Instead, you actually want to film it vertically, up, and down. That\u2019s the way IGTV and Insta Stories are working and that\u2019s how you get the best look.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, you are saving yourself some time in post-production because you don\u2019t have to spend an hour or two to edit your video, crop it, and re-frame it so that it looks good.<\/p>\n<p>So always post vertical or square videos on Instagram. It will get more likes, more comments, and ultimately more leads for your business.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5636\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/video-aspect-ratio-on-mobile-devices.png\" alt=\"video aspect ratio on mobile devices\" width=\"465\" height=\"246\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/video-aspect-ratio-on-mobile-devices.png 465w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/video-aspect-ratio-on-mobile-devices-300x159.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Tip #2 Give your videos a \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d feel<\/h2>\n<p>A lot of times, as a service provider you want to use Instagram to show the best of the best of your business. You want to give your audience a glimpse of the internal stuff that\u2019s going on and that makes your business different.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-instagram-stories-can-enhance-account-growth\/\">Insta Stories<\/a> is a great way to tap into the behind-the-scenes. For example, if you\u2019re into the video editing business like me, on your main page on your YouTube you probably want to show awesome videos, the final cuts, right?<\/p>\n<p>But on your Insta Stories, you can show your video editing process, explain how you cut videos, what video rendering settings you\u2019re using, and stuff that happens before people get to see the finished product of whatever your business is doing.<\/p>\n<p>And this can be applied to any industry. You can film and show your audience your process in your own niche. And that way people will know that when they can come back to your IG Stories, they expect to see a certain type of content. That\u2019s how you grow your following.<\/p>\n<h2>Tip #3 Don\u2019t neglect quality<\/h2>\n<p>People expect a certain quality these days when they watch online videos, regardless if it\u2019s on YouTube, Facebook or Instagram. Maybe not on TikTok yet, joking &#x1f60a;. Especially from people or brands that are trying to sell them something at the end of the day.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5637\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/do-not-neglect-quality.jpg\" alt=\"do not neglect quality\" width=\"390\" height=\"261\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/do-not-neglect-quality.jpg 390w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/do-not-neglect-quality-300x201.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So, keep in mind that you will need good lighting, a good camera, <a href=\"https:\/\/extremevideomarketing.com\/blog\/why-quality-audio-is-so-important\/\">good audio<\/a> (yes, even on Instagram), and good video editing. These are all the things you want to remember when you\u2019re doing IGTV or Instagram Stories. It\u2019s really no different than creating other types of videos that you would invest more in, such as product videos, or training videos, or any videos that would go on your business website for example.<\/p>\n<p>All the video content you put out represents your brand, your service, and what you have to offer to your clients, regardless of the platform you are using.<\/p>\n<p>The better the quality, the better the results you will see from your video marketing efforts.<\/p>\n<p>One quick tip here that\u2019s slightly more technical and that I noticed many content creators doing \u2013 is to watch your frame rate. People tend to film videos at 60 frames per second these days, but unless you\u2019re doing slow-motion scenes that will actually hurt video quality as it lets in less light in your videos.<\/p>\n<p>So, shoot in 30 or 24 frames per second instead.<\/p>\n<h2>Tip #4 Get your titles and video cover game on<\/h2>\n<p>I cannot emphasize the importance of this tip enough.<\/p>\n<p>Your headlines and video covers (or thumbnails) are what people see first and based on that they will make the decision to scroll or tap on your videos.<\/p>\n<p>So that\u2019s when you really want to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.socialmediaimpact.com\/how-to-create-clickable-video-thumbnails-for-successful-social-media-campaigns\/\">capture their attention<\/a>. The best way to do that is to include emotion. Emotional-based video covers will make more people want to click and watch the video. The same thing is valid for the headline.<\/p>\n<p>So, what you can do for IGTV for example, because IGTV is pre-recorded, is to actually take a still photo of yourself after you are done filming, try to make to transmit emotion through that image, and use it as a video cover.<\/p>\n<p>You will notice that more people will click through and eventually stick around to watch the video.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t fall on the other side of this though. Your video cover can be intriguing for sure, but it doesn\u2019t have to be clickbaity. Otherwise, people will just bounce right away which is not good for metrics and for the IG algorithm.<\/p>\n<p>A PRO tip here that I started experimenting with later on is to have 2 or 3 different thumbnails or video covers ready to go for the same IGTV post and rotate them to see which one gets you the most engagement. Yeah, it is a little bit of extra work but sometimes it does pay off big time.<\/p>\n<h2>TIP #5 Create series<\/h2>\n<p>Last but not least, as the name success, it is Instagram <strong>TV<\/strong>. So, you might want to think more of the TV aspect of the platform.<\/p>\n<p>Creating a daily or weekly schedule where you put up a series of episodes really helps with increasing viewership loyalty and ultimately conversions.<\/p>\n<p>For example, one of my video editing clients is doing cooking. So every day they do a little segment on Instagram teaching a quick recipe. This has become their \u201ctelevision\u201d program that people are now daily tuning in to.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, you don\u2019t necessarily have to do it daily, but if you can create episodes of yourself or your business you will build a highly relevant community around a specific topic that tends to convert really, really well.<\/p>\n<p>This is a very important tip. Do series of videos around the same topic or niche, don\u2019t just post videos on random subjects because that will not work as well.<\/p>\n<h2>Over to you<\/h2>\n<p>So now you know some of my best tips to absolutely step up your Instagram marketing game.<\/p>\n<p>Remember to always upload vertical or square videos, don\u2019t neglect the technical aspects such as lighting, audio quality, spot-on editing. Give your audience a behind-the-scenes look when you can and definitely optimize your titles and video covers.<\/p>\n<p>Last but not least, and this is valid across all platforms, create quality content. That\u2019s it from my side.
