This trend is an advantage for the salesforce who work from the comfort of their homes in promoting their employer&#8217;s services or products.<\/p>\n<p>Roller (2015) states the most significant impact on our workforce environment is due to technology being prevalent in all aspects of social life.\u00a0 The dynamic and technologic effects have changed our everyday life in how we interact, communicate, recruit, social life, and work.<\/p>\n<p>The utilization of technology platforms has become our method of marketing to sell products, post job, and recruitment, promote business in social media, announce new products and latest technology.\u00a0 The information technology, network systems, and data communication are skills requirements for all of us to survive this technology generation.\u00a0 Technology provides the required tools to promote, recruit and screen potential candidates when searching for employees. An example is LinkedIn, which as the tool to use for highly skilled candidates; this platform is a medium used to post open opportunities, attract, screen and identify the most qualified candidates.<\/p>\n<p>Any business can use social media to promote and advertise its products and gain recognition in our communities. Business communication has shifted from a standard document via fax to emails and small text messages.\u00a0 Considering the demand for fast, quick connections by electronic notes, there are also situations that a formal memo or a letter is required.\u00a0 This approach applies to our internal and external audience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Employee culture, work-life, engagement<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google is one of the first enterprises of the country&#8217;s 100-list of best companies to work.\u00a0 According to Google&#8217;s Great Place Work information employees participate and collaborate effectively.\u00a0 Google has over 200 teams and learns that team dynamics work better than the individual or structured groups.\u00a0 It is not just the high pay, benefits and excellent perks offered to its employees, not just the flexibility and technological resources, but significant difference factor is how Google values, fosters and provides support programs to its employees, which makes it a significant contributor to our world. (Fortune 100 List, 2017).\u00a0 Other organizations are following this trend and finding ways to sync and connect through social media, screen and recruit the best candidates for their business, retain and grow to build a competitive edge.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Generations in the workplace<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Previously an office setting relied on a fax machine and regular mail correspondence to runt their business, and this is no longer feasible.\u00a0 When instant messaging (IM) and email were introduced to the business environment, this created a new way of day to day operation in any business entity.\u00a0 The internet marketing approach initiated and social media platforms are used where a broader audience is targeted and attracted to the business.\u00a0 These days, most households rely on internet services and have at least one computer, and smartphone, or electronic devices that allow this access to marketers.<\/p>\n<p>The way we did business in the 90&#8217;s is in the past; there are new opportunities and challenges that we face about security and internet regulations.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Further review and enforcement guidelines must be in place to protect information accessible through this electronic media.\u00a0 The recent data breach to the credit bureaus in 2017 and 2018 is an indicator of how sensible confidential data is exposed and can end up in the wrong hands. It is imperative there are specific regulations to protect the consumers from these cyber attacks that can affect anyone, including the government.<\/p>\n<p>The Group Y, also known as the millennials is the new generation to target for this century.\u00a0 The group is formed by recent graduate students who are familiar with all gadgets in technology and are the future workforce for organizations.\u00a0 The strategic plan to manage this changing trend in human capital should focus on training, engagement, benefit packages, technological, and flexibility.\u00a0\u00a0 Ji\u0159\u00ed, B. (2016).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The success of any corporation&#8217;s success in the last decades has changed and transitioned the focus on investing in promoting the usage of internet marketing and social media platforms to expand and gain a competitive edge in the competitive global economy.\u00a0 It is essential for companies to promote their services and products through the various technology platforms.\u00a0\u00a0 The universal, technological, and competitive areas have shifted how corporations operate and succeed in their businesses, and this continues to change as we enter the new century.<\/p>\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>References<\/p>\n<p>Fortune 100 List.
