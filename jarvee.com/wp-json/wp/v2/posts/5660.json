While it can make a company more profitable, it definitely makes the business more difficult because you need to take care of multiple features simultaneously.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/5-tips-to-make-fantastic-videos-for-your-social-networks\/\">Social networks<\/a> have become one of the most impactful features of the new era of business, mostly thanks to their ability to reach <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/272014\/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users\/\">billions of users<\/a> all over the globe within seconds. But that\u2019s not the only advantage of social media marketing \u2013 it also helps people and organizations to raise awareness, boost authority, interact with potential customers, and many more.<\/p>\n<p>Being such a valuable business resource, you should embrace social platforms and learn the best tactics to make it work for your company. In this post, we will discuss 10 ways to increase your business profit with social media. Let\u2019s begin!<\/p>\n<h2>1. Build a Memorable Brand<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to grow sales and expand the business, you have to build a memorable brand. The goal is to make the audience remember your company using consistent social media features.<\/p>\n<p>First of all, you should concentrate on relevant platforms only and add basic information about the business: descriptions, website addresses, phone numbers, emails, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, you have to ensure visual consistency across all channels of communication. That includes all of the key visual components such as logos, cover images, color schemes, marketing templates, and fonts. Why is it so important?<\/p>\n<p>Studies show that colors <a href=\"https:\/\/techjury.net\/stats-about\/branding\/\">raise brand recognition<\/a> by 80%, whereas 90% of customers expect you to be equally active on all channels. Therefore, you have to play it consistently and guarantee the same experience on every platform.<\/p>\n<h2>2.\u00a0Mix Top-Notch Content to Grow the Number of Followers<\/h2>\n<p>A lot of businesses are struggling to grow the number of social media followers without knowing the real reason for the status quo. As it turns out, they don\u2019t create enough high-quality posts and don\u2019t mix content formats to make their accounts more interesting and versatile.<\/p>\n<p>Our suggestion for you is to combine all sorts of posts long-term in order to maximize the value of your content. After all, how can you expect the fans to keep enjoying and supporting your activities if you only publish textual posts? The only way out is to use different types of social posts and make the channel more entertaining. Here are only some of the formats you can add to the mix:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Textual posts<\/li>\n<li>Images, animations, and infographics<\/li>\n<li>Videos, GIFs, and live videos<\/li>\n<li>Memes<\/li>\n<li>Graphs and charts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>3.\u00a0Drive Traffic to the Website<\/h2>\n<p>Another thing you can do with social media is to drive traffic to the business website. Some people begin exploring a company through websites directly, but a large portion of users now take a different turn and start from social media accounts directly.<\/p>\n<p>In such circumstances, you should help them get to the source and visit your site. For example, Instagram allows you to add only one link in the bio section. Of course, businesses use the opportunity to add a URL leading users to their official websites or landing pages.<\/p>\n<p>You should follow the same example and take advantage of social media as the source of traffic generation.<\/p>\n<h2>4.\u00a0Boost Website Ranking<\/h2>\n<p>This tip goes hand in hand with the previous one because you can turn social media into a genuine website ranking booster. Although experts still can\u2019t determine whether social platforms influence search engine optimization (SEO) directly, the fact remains that they <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bluecorona.com\/blog\/how-does-social-media-affect-seo\">affect your search ranking<\/a> in at least four ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Social networks play the role of visibility boosters and generate more traffic<\/li>\n<li>Social networks increase professional authority and brand recognition<\/li>\n<li>Social networks enable wider content distribution<\/li>\n<li>Social networks contribute to local SEO efforts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Besides that, we strongly encourage you to add <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/ultimate-social-media-plus\/\">social sharing buttons<\/a> to the website because it will give an additional push to business promotion.<\/p>\n<h2>5.\u00a0Tell Stories and Promote Values<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Tell-Stories-and-Promote-Values.jpg\" alt=\"Tell Stories and Promote Values\" width=\"624\" height=\"420\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5662\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Tell-Stories-and-Promote-Values.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Tell-Stories-and-Promote-Values-300x202.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Tell-Stories-and-Promote-Values-600x404.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>According to the research, over 60% of consumers say that <a href=\"https:\/\/info.zimmercommunications.com\/blog\/20-stats-that-will-remind-you-of-the-importance-of-your-branding\">shared values<\/a> are the main reason that they have a trusted relationship with a brand. What does this fact tell you?<\/p>\n<p>Well, it should inspire you to think about creating a storytelling strategy. People love to hear a good story, especially if it suits their beliefs, values, and interests. Your job is to seize the opportunity and find a way to promote brand-specific values through carefully designed stories.<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6aFdEhEZQjE\">Google\u2019s Year in Search<\/a> for example. It\u2019s a wonderful piece of video content that the largest search engine used to celebrate \u201call the good that people discovered in 2018.\u201d The idea is simple but very effective, and we hope it can inspire you to try doing similar things with your social media content.<\/p>\n<h2>6.\u00a0Use Social Media to Drive Conversion<\/h2>\n<p>If your main goal is to increase sales through every channel of professional communication, then you should also take advantage of social networks. How can you do it?<\/p>\n<p>The answer lies in clear and cleverly planned calls to action (CTA).<\/p>\n<p>A CTA is simply a part of your post that encourages users to engage based on your instructions. For example, Instagram marketers often use a CTA such as: \u201cFollow the link in bio.\u201d However, you have to be smart and create direct and understandable CTAs.<\/p>\n<p>Make them stand out and look different than the rest of the content to grab the attention of social media fans. Take a look at this example &#8211; their CTA is red and sends a clear message to Order Now. Therefore, a user cannot fail to notice it or get the message wrong.<\/p>\n<h2>7.\u00a0Provide Value before Asking for Engagement<\/h2>\n<p>Another thing you need to know is that social media followers demand maximum quality in the long run. If you want them to keep following your brand and become full-time customers eventually, you need to offer some real value through the content.<\/p>\n<p>The point is to create and publish amazing content that really solves people\u2019s pain points and helps them to handle everyday problems quickly and effortlessly. In case you can do that, rest assured your followers will be willing to take action.<\/p>\n<p>Here is the extra tip for you &#8211; try to follow the famous 80\/20 principle when creating fresh content. The rule is to publish 80% of informative and educational posts while saving only 20% of posts for business promotion. That way, you\u2019ll make a perfect balance between value and marketing.<\/p>\n<h2>8.\u00a0Advertise to Attract Verified Leads<\/h2>\n<p>Almost every social network has an excellent advertising system that makes it possible to target users very precisely. You can use it to approach a highly specific group of prospects and attract only verified leads that have enough potential to become full-time buyers.<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/ads\">Facebook Ads<\/a> for instance. The platform enables extremely accurate targeting options, thus allowing you to target core, custom, or lookalike audiences. Every solution has its own advantages, but each one is super-powerful when it comes to increasing conversion rates.<\/p>\n<h2>9.\u00a0Build Relationships through Social Interaction<\/h2>\n<p>Building relationships with your fans is yet another way to boost your business profit with social media. What you need to do is promote engagement and try to turn regular followers into loyal brand advocates who are going to stick to your products long-term.<\/p>\n<p>This is extremely important because studies prove that 80% of a company\u2019s sales come from <a href=\"https:\/\/marketinginsidergroup.com\/strategy\/marketing-80-20-rule-take-advantage\/\">20% of its customers<\/a>.\u00a0Besides that, loyal consumers tend to purchase more items and spend more money than new buyers.<\/p>\n<p>Our suggestion is to communicate with your social media fans on a regular basis. Ask them questions, answer their comments, re-share their posts, etc. All these tricks will make your business seem friendlier and more natural, thus helping you to grow the base of loyal customers.<\/p>\n<h2>10. Analyze Your Competitors<\/h2>\n<p>The last tip on our list won\u2019t help you to generate revenue directly, but it will give you the opportunity to learn more about a given niche and find new techniques for business promotion. Your competitors should have their own social media pages as well, so you should monitor their activities and see how they are trying to attract new followers.<\/p>\n<p>It will give you additional insights into the pros and cons of their marketing strategies. You\u2019ll get to see what they are doing properly, but you will also identify their shortcomings and use those findings to make your business stand out among similar brands and companies.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to find a marketing channel more influential than social networks. The likes of Facebook and Instagram completely changed the way marketers plan and execute campaigns, thus making the job more complex and more impactful at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>Social media marketing can help your organization to flourish, but you have to understand the state of the art tactics to design quality campaigns on these platforms. In this post, we analyzed 10 ways to increase your business profit with social media.<\/p>\n<p>Which one do you think is the most valuable?
