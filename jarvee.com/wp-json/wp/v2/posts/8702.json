While all of this technology offers substantial benefits for the small business owner, it can also eat up a lot of your time \u2014 time that may be better spent elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>Knowing when to delegate is key to success in business and life. When you try to do too much on your own, you risk spreading yourself thin, making mistakes, and hurting the quality of the final product. Here\u2019s why it pays to outsource to experts or invest in automation software like <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/\">JARVEE<\/a> to help your business thrive!<\/p>\n<h2>Knowing When to Outsource<\/h2>\n<p>While the growing population of freelancers has made outsourcing an affordable option for small business owners, hiring someone else to take on your work isn\u2019t always the best solution. Sometimes it makes sense to outsource and sometimes it doesn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>Entrepreneur recommends asking whether <a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/324847\">outsourcing<\/a> a particular task will push your business forward. If you lack the expertise needed to build an e-commerce store, run an effective marketing campaign, or produce engaging content, outsourcing to an expert could be well worth it! Don&#8217;t try to learn a new skill set when you can easily and affordably hire someone who already has the expertise you need. That said, if you can find software that simplifies a task enough that you can handle it on your own, you might not need to outsource in the end.<\/p>\n<p>Below, we\u2019ve outlined some common tech tasks that are worth outsourcing!<\/p>\n<h2>Data Entry<\/h2>\n<p>Outsourcing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smallbusinessbonfire.com\/small-businesses-data-entry-outsourcing\/\">data entry<\/a> alone can save you several hours every week. Data entry tasks are essential to your business, but they\u2019re also time-consuming and repetitive, which makes them an excellent candidate for outsourcing! Remember, your time has value. Every hour you spend on data entry is another hour you could have used to focus on core business activities, like pursuing leads and new opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, it\u2019s easy to outsource data entry through online job boards. Use websites like Upwork to connect with professionals and compare<a href=\"https:\/\/www.upwork.com\/services\/data-entry\"> data entry<\/a> services so you can find the best fit for your budget and project timeline. Just make sure you pick a data entry professional with a track record for meticulous and diligent work!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/data-entry-services.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"787\" height=\"521\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Accounting<\/h2>\n<p>Accounting is another one of those time-consuming administrative tasks best left to the pros. Hiring a <a href=\"https:\/\/smallbusiness.yahoo.com\/advisor\/resource-center\/6-reasons-outsource-accounting-operations-035741641\/\">professional accountant<\/a> will not only save time but help you avoid common bookkeeping mistakes that can cause major headaches down the road. For example, your accountant will ensure you file your business taxes correctly and take advantage of all the benefits that are available to you. Compared to hiring an in-house bookkeeping professional, outsourcing to a freelance accountant can save you a lot of money in the long run!<\/p>\n<h2>Web Design and Development<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to website <a href=\"https:\/\/www.godaddy.com\/garage\/build-your-own-website-vs-hiring-a-web-pro\/\">design and development<\/a>, deciding whether or not to outsource will depend on your unique situation. If you operate a physical retail space and you just need to establish a local business page online, going the DIY route with an online website builder should be sufficient.<\/p>\n<p>If, on the other hand, your business relies entirely on your website or you require complex custom applications and a unique design, you\u2019re better off hiring a web professional. Web developers can also help you customize websites built on platforms like WordPress and Shopify. This is a great option if you\u2019re looking for custom solutions on a budget.<\/p>\n<h2>Social Media Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Many small business owners overlook the fact that social media is an incredibly nuanced form of digital marketing that requires skill and understanding to execute successfully. By outsourcing to a freelance social media marketer, you can ensure your business remains up to date with the latest <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/7-important-social-media-trends-you-need-to-know-in-2021\/\">social media trends<\/a> that will keep you visible and relevant. The expertise that freelancers bring to the table is unmatched by general employees.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, automation software can help you work with your social media professionals to keep your marketing strategy organized and efficient. Social media automation enables you to do everything from scheduling posts in advance to connecting with users in your niche. Take advantage of tools like these to optimize your social strategy!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/social-media-marketing.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"801\" height=\"534\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Content Creation<\/h2>\n<p>Great content is at the heart of every successful marketing strategy. Producing unique, valuable, and engaging content will build trust with your customers and help grow your brand identity. Businesses of any size can benefit from a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/johnrampton\/2017\/05\/28\/your-small-business-needs-a-content-strategy-here-is-a-plan-you-can-start-today\/?sh=59462425741f\">content strategy<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>However, creating content is incredibly time-consuming. The quality of your content\u2014and the level of value it provides to your audience\u2014will reflect the amount of time and attention you put in. This is another area where it pays to hire help! Look for freelance writers, graphic designers, cinematographers, photographers, video editors, and podcast producers who can help you create the content that you envision for your brand.<\/p>\n<h2>Cybersecurity<\/h2>\n<p>For the small business owner, cybersecurity may seem like an unnecessary investment. But small businesses are frequently targeted by cybercriminals because of their security vulnerabilities. Protecting your business from an attack should be your top priority, and since cyberthreats are becoming increasingly sophisticated, it\u2019s best to outsource your <a href=\"https:\/\/resources.infosecinstitute.com\/topic\/outsourcing-cybersecurity-what-services-to-outsource-what-to-keep-in-house\/\">cybersecurity needs<\/a> instead of trying to cover all your bases on your own.<\/p>\n<p>You should be able to find a cybersecurity solution that meets the needs of your business without blowing your budget. For example, hiring a cybersecurity consultant is a great option for small businesses. Your consultant can help you identify weaknesses in your security strategy and help you implement solutions to safeguard your business without having to pay for a full-time security professional.<\/p>\n<p>Outsourcing is a great way to increase the growth potential for your business. You just don\u2019t have the time to juggle data entry, accounting, social media, cybersecurity, and all of those other tech tasks on your own. Beyond time savings, the main benefit of outsourcing is the opportunity to onboard professionals who are the best at what they do. Hiring freelancers will help you round out your weaknesses so you can focus on your strengths!<\/p>\n<p>Are you looking for solutions to automate your social media strategy? <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/\">JARVEE<\/a> can help!
