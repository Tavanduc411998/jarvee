Additionally, around 64 percent of them have increasingly used AV content including webinars.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you are looking forward to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.onehourprofessor.com\/best-webinar-software-platforms\/\">using a webinar<\/a> as a method to promote your brand or product, here are some ways you can be creative on different social media.<\/p>\n<h2>Employ visuals during the promotion<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8154\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/visuals.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/visuals.png 715w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/visuals-300x164.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/visuals-600x328.png 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/visuals-400x218.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>First, to promote webinars on social media, you should <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/10-types-of-visual-content-to-use-in-your-content-marketing\/\">prepare visual content<\/a> that goes well with the theme.\u00a0 It could be in the form of a teaser or simple original graphics. This tends to attract more eyes compared to a shared link or a casual text post about your webinar. Visuals are more attractive in terms of bringing in more target audiences effectively, so grab the limelight by using exciting and engaging visuals.<\/p>\n<h2>Add a clear CTA<\/h2>\n<p>Informing people about your webinar is not sufficient. Your viewers must also be aware of what to do after content viewing. Provide a clear CTA informing them about the successive steps of the process. CTAs can be either in text captions or in one of your promotional images. Moreover, the webinar host can add a verbal Call-to-Action in the video.<\/p>\n<p>Another way by which you can make sure your viewers know exactly what to do in the next step is by including 2 CTAs within captions. This will create a larger impact on the audience.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8155\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/call-to-action.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"261\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/call-to-action.jpg 1170w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/call-to-action-300x121.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/call-to-action-1024x411.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/call-to-action-768x309.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/call-to-action-600x241.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Establish an appealing landing page<\/h2>\n<p>As soon as a person clicks on your webinar link on <a href=\"https:\/\/automonkey.co\/social-networking-sites-of-the-world\/\">any social media platform<\/a>, it takes him to a particular landing page that is specially designed for your webinar.<\/p>\n<p>You should make this as creative as possible before you even begin with the promotion of your webinar. If the landing page is not appealing or well-designed, it could potentially confuse your attendees or viewer and not meet their expectations and they might just skip registering themselves.<\/p>\n<p>The landing page must have all the basic information of your webinar along with a brief form for collecting the attendees\u2019 contact details like emails, name, contact number, etc. But do not collect unnecessary information because you do not want to annoy your viewers.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8156\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/landing-page.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"366\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/landing-page.png 1200w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/landing-page-300x157.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/landing-page-1024x536.png 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/landing-page-768x402.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/landing-page-600x314.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Once the landing page is completed, do not forget to optimize it by inserting a teaser clipping of your webinar. You may have shared a teaser clipping on your social media channels and another on your landing page, this will essentially keep your audience hooked and engaged.<\/p>\n<p>These videos tend to define the objective, benefits, and the idea behind your webinar but make sure they do not bore your audience. The video is perfect for those who do not like to read through text blocks to gather necessary information about your webinar.<\/p>\n<h2>Optimization of the landing page<\/h2>\n<p>Optimization of the content and teaser video on the landing page is not the end. It is equally important to optimize the page for sharing. The promotion of webinars, especially via social media channels, requires you to gather help from those who are already aware of it and are willing to attend it.<\/p>\n<p>Take their help and let them promote your webinar for you. Essentially, it is like arranging people to share details of the webinar on social media that ultimately directs them to your landing page.<\/p>\n<p>Another noteworthy feature is to add buttons for sharing webinars on social media that take them to the landing page. This is a very simple but effective way of accomplishing your target. The buttons have an important effect on viewers\u2019 actions. Do not forget to optimize these sharing buttons since they can potentially <a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialmediaexaminer.com\/one-business-increased-facebook-fans\/\">increase content sharing almost by 200 percent<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As soon as people complete their registration process for attending your webinar, motivate them to pass on the information to their friends and family on social media. Through this, you get added chance of attracting more attendees, and hence, increasing the rate of registration.<\/p>\n<h2>Run advertisements<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8158\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/social-media-ads.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/social-media-ads.png 1600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/social-media-ads-300x158.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/social-media-ads-1024x538.png 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/social-media-ads-768x403.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/social-media-ads-600x315.png 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/social-media-ads-1536x806.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Last but not the least, improve the effectiveness of your promotional efforts by preparing and sharing advertisements on different social media platforms.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/6-tips-on-how-to-design-outstanding-instagram-ads\/\">The ads should be engaging and compelling<\/a>, make sure they are carefully and beautifully designed,\u00a0and of course, they should meet the expectation of your target audience. Remember your target should include the most relevant viewers for whom the ad is made.<\/p>\n<p>For creating an above-par ad quality, partner with a few of the top influential people in your niche. Take their help to spread more details about the webinar. Reach a wider range of audiences through them and chances of getting more registration will increase. However, the content should be worth enough promoting by the influencer.<\/p>\n<p>The graphics mentioned above can have an appealing image along with the information regarding your webinar or simply a teaser video, clearly explaining the objectives of the webinar. Added to this, you can include a chain of influencer-hosted videos about the webinar.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>So, all in all, a webinar is an amazing way of informing and engaging your target audience. Other than generating or converting new leads into potential clients, you also get a well-defined platform for building established connections with a wide range of people.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.on24.com\/resources\/asset\/on24-webinar-benchmarks-report-special-edition-post-covid-trends\/\">ON24 states that around 76 percent of the online marketers believe<\/a> that webinars have allowed them to generate more leads while 75 percent of them have agreed that it helps in extending their brand reach to wider coverage.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, if you are want to leverage boost the success of your webinars and increase the awareness of your product or brand, driving more engagement and leads, follow the 5 creative ways and you are good to go.<\/p>\n<h3>About the author:<\/h3>\n<p>Ankit Thakor is a marketer by trade and a football player by passion.
