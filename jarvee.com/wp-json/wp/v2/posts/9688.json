As we know it, the latter is a crucial aspect for every business in the 21st century.<\/p>\n<p>To <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.adzooma.com\/blog\/10-top-tips-for-instagram-marketers\/\">help boost engagement<\/a><\/u>, Instagram offers many interesting tools and features\u2014one of them is story highlights.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram story highlights are collections of the previously posted stories on your profile. But unlike stories, they don\u2019t have a shelf-life of 24 hours and are visible to viewers whenever they visit your profile.<\/p>\n<p>Placed right under your bio, highlights are one of the first things people notice on your profile and can drive first impressions that directly impact purchase decisions. So, if there\u2019s an aspect for you to pay attention to on Instagram, it\u2019s story highlights!<\/p>\n<p>Instagram also provides rich <a href=\"https:\/\/whatagraph.com\/templates\/instagram-analytics-report-template\">analytics<\/a> of your stories. In the Insights section of your profile, you\u2019ll find every important metric you\u2019ll need to improve performance\u2014like profile visits, reach, impressions, replies, and more. You can combine the data from here along with <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.clicdata.com\/blog\/marketing-kpis-saas-companies\/\">key business metrics<\/a><\/u> from other sources like your website analytics to generate more traffic, leads, and sales.<\/p>\n<p>As a business, Instagram Story Highlights should be an integral part of your marketing strategy. Let\u2019s explore five ways you can use them to engage your customers and promote your business:<\/p>\n<h3><strong>1. Start with an \u2018About us\u2019 highlight<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Instagram bio limits you to 150 characters, and you can\u2019t convey every detail about your brand here.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where <u><a href=\"https:\/\/invideo.io\/blog\/instagram-story-ideas\/\">Instagram story<\/a><\/u> highlights step in. An \u2018About us\u2019 highlight is a superb opportunity to explain your brand story\u2014through a series of stories. It helps users understand who you are, what you do, and what products\/services you offer right away.<\/p>\n<p>An authentic \u2018About us\u2019 highlight can go a long way in setting your brand apart and building a connection with users.<strong> @<\/strong>atomandmatter here uses an \u2018Our story\u2019 highlight to communicate what its brand is about and its values.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9700\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Start-with-an-\u2018About-us-highlight.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"289\" height=\"460\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Start-with-an-\u2018About-us-highlight.png 289w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Start-with-an-\u2018About-us-highlight-188x300.png 188w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If not \u2018About us,\u2019 you can create an FAQ highlight and answer any initial questions viewers may have about your brand. It\u2019s a great way to establish what you represent and your policies.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how @anomalyhaircare does it.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9699\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Start-with-an-\u2018About-us-highlight.-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"285\" height=\"434\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Start-with-an-\u2018About-us-highlight.-2.png 285w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Start-with-an-\u2018About-us-highlight.-2-197x300.png 197w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 285px) 100vw, 285px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Showcase your products<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>In a 2019 Facebook survey, 62% of people said they became more interested in a brand or product through <u><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-instagram-stories-can-enhance-account-growth\/\">Instagram stories<\/a><\/u>. This shows the power stories have to educate people about your product and build interest in it.<\/p>\n<p>A great strategy to show people what you offer is to create dedicated product highlights. You can either create a unique highlight for every product or club all products under one.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how product highlights help:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>They give viewers a quick look into your offerings.<\/li>\n<li>If you create different highlights for every product, users can easily navigate and find details about the product of their choice\u2014without having to scroll through your entire feed. This is exactly how @florencebymills showcases its products.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9697\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Showcase-your-products.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"254\" height=\"404\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Showcase-your-products.png 254w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Showcase-your-products-189x300.png 189w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 254px) 100vw, 254px\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can use swipe-up links to take users directly to your website in product stories, as shown below<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9698\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Showcase-your-products-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"247\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Showcase-your-products-2.png 247w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Showcase-your-products-2-174x300.png 174w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 247px) 100vw, 247px\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you\u2019ve set up <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.datafeedwatch.com\/blog\/leverage-instagram-shopping-multichannel-strategy\">Instagram shopping,<\/a><\/u> you can use the \u2018Product\u2019 sticker and tag the product shown in the Story like @madewell.

Given how accessible they are, users are more likely to click on them to see what you offer and whether it interests them.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Make tutorials or how-to\u2019s <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Tutorials showing your product use-case are excellent ways to appeal to audiences. They give viewers an understanding of your product, the benefits it offers, and how exactly they can use it.<\/p>\n<p>By putting these videos in your highlights, you allow visitors to watch them anytime, thus opening opportunities to win more clients.<\/p>\n<p>@countrybeancoffee has a highlight of recipes made using their products\u2014it\u2019s perfect for showing how you can use their product in new and interesting ways.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9694\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Make-tutorials-or-how-to.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"232\" height=\"414\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Make-tutorials-or-how-to.png 232w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Make-tutorials-or-how-to-168x300.png 168w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To take it up a notch, you can show your customers using your product. This can reaffirm potential clients\u2019 faith in your product and entice them into buying it.<\/p>\n<p>Another way to build your brand and a loyal audience for yourself on Instagram is to provide tips and how-to guides on your story highlights, like @d.signers here.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9693\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Make-tutorials-or-how-to-guides.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"232\" height=\"369\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Make-tutorials-or-how-to-guides.png 232w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Make-tutorials-or-how-to-guides-189x300.png 189w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Creating tutorials might seem like a lot of work, but there are a lot of easy-to-use <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nitdit.com\/best-instagram-apps\/\">Instagram tools<\/a><\/u> that make this easy.<\/p>\n<p>This way, you get to educate your followers, build credibility, and establish yourself as an industry expert by showcasing your knowledge.\u00a0 Don\u2019t forget to use the swipe-up option when it\u2019s relevant to try to drive people to sign-up for something of value here as well.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you give helpful tips\/info and then offer a free step-by-step PDF download if they sign up for your email list, this will allow you to gather their email and use email marketing to further build the relationship.<\/p>\n<p>If this sounds like a good idea but you don\u2019t have any idea what email platform would be best for this, <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.onehourprofessor.com\/best-email-marketing-software-services\/\">check out this list<\/a><\/u> to learn your options.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4. Create a Q&amp;A highlight <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Instagram Stories provide many engagement-boosting features like polls, quiz stickers, emoji sliders, and the question sticker\u2014which opens many possibilities for interaction.<\/p>\n<p>Just like <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesmate.io\/web-forms\/\">online web forms<\/a><\/u>, this sticker allows you to ask your audience questions and answer them either via DM or on your stories\u2014without revealing their identity.<\/p>\n<p>Having Q&amp;A sessions on Instagram is a good practice to build and enhance your presence on the platform. It shows your expertise, allows you to solve your audience\u2019s pain points, and clarifies doubts about your brand and industry.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, it shows you care about your audience and take out the time to interact with them.<\/p>\n<p>Over time, you can compile all stories containing important answers into a Highlight\u2014so all new and old visitors can access them anytime they want.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, @d.signers has an extensive Q&amp;A highlight where it answered questions about architecture, design, and careers in this field.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9689\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/create-Q-and-A-highlights.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"245\" height=\"434\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/create-Q-and-A-highlights.png 245w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/create-Q-and-A-highlights-169x300.png 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><strong>5. Share reviews and testimonials <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Reviews and testimonials instantly grab people\u2019s attention and what better place to showcase them than an Instagram highlight?<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s simple\u2014post screenshots of your customers\u2019 reviews on your stories regularly and put your best reviews together in a highlight like @anomalyhaircare.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9695\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Share-reviews-and-testimonials-.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"252\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Share-reviews-and-testimonials-.png 252w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Share-reviews-and-testimonials--191x300.png 191w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This section will help build trust and credibility with new visitors and those thinking of making a purchase.
