You might get away with some clumsy or even funny looking pictures on Instagram stories, but the images on your profile must be inspiring, creative and should stand out to be able to capture your customers&#8217; attention. After all, you want followers that are actual human beings, not bots.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have a designer&#8217;s degree don&#8217;t worry, here&#8217;s a quick guide on how to use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canva.com\/instagram\/\">Canva<\/a> for free and create posts that will hopefully gain a bunch of new followers, likes, and comments.<\/p>\n<p>With Canva you can do a lot of marketing materials, from blog graphics to ebooks, flyers, brochures, banners and so on. But we will focus on how to create Instagram posts.<\/p>\n<p>First, you need to create a Canva account for free. Next, choose the Instagram post from the templates in the Dashboard.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1914\" src=\"http:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/canva-dashboard.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/canva-dashboard.jpg 690w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/canva-dashboard-300x203.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/canva-dashboard-600x406.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll notice there are a lot of free templates and layouts to choose from. They also have free backgrounds or some at the cost of $1. They also offer free high-quality photos you can use in the &#8220;Elements&#8221; tab, &#8220;Free Photos&#8221; section.<\/p>\n<p>The best way though is to use your own images or free images available on websites like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pexels.com\">pexels<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/\">unsplash<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/pixabay.com\/\">pixabay<\/a> or other <a href=\"http:\/\/jarvee.com\/best-places-get-free-images-content\/\">similar websites<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So, go to uploads and upload your own images.<\/p>\n<h3>How to choose your images:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>try choosing high-quality images that are relevant to the text you want to add on top of it. This will make you look more professional and thoughtful.<\/li>\n<li>choose images that are similar and go well with each other. Try creating a theme or a story on your Instagram account. You don&#8217;t want to confuse your followers with too different concepts or too busy backgrounds.<\/li>\n<li>if your purpose is to create quoted images choose photos with a lot of space where the text will be placed. You want it to be easy to read, so try avoiding too busy backgrounds with too many elements or colors.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once you found your images and uploaded to Canva, you can then add them to the white canvas and start creating your Instagram post template. You&#8217;ll notice that you can apply filters and edit the image if you want. Or, simply just add some blur to create more contrast with the text that will be added next.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1915\" src=\"http:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/filter-instagram-post.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"623\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/filter-instagram-post.jpg 623w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/filter-instagram-post-300x241.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/filter-instagram-post-600x482.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you want to create quoted Instagram posts you&#8217;ll need some good resources for the quotes. Here is a list of websites where you can find interesting quotes and inspirational content to use in your posts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>1.<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.brainyquote.com\/\">Brainy Quote<\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>2.<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/startupquote.com\/\">Startup Quote<\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>3.<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.quotegarden.com\/\">Quote Garden<\/a><\/p>\n<p>We all know that quotes work really well on Instagram. Of course, it depends on your niche and the type of Instagram account that you have. But even so, you can add one quote that is relevant to your niche every once in a while to mix things up a bit.<\/p>\n<p>Keep a cheat sheet with all the quotes you want to use on your Instagram posts. Now go to your Instagram post template and add the quote you want to your previously chosen background.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1916\" src=\"http:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/add-quotes-to-instagram-post.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"409\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/add-quotes-to-instagram-post.jpg 690w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/add-quotes-to-instagram-post-300x178.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/add-quotes-to-instagram-post-600x356.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can use the templates they offer if that makes sense to your image and text, or you can edit it. You can change the font, the size, and the color. You can choose different sizes or different fonts to make it stand out more. Just use your creativity. If you need inspiration for this go to Pinterest and search for quotes. You&#8217;ll see that with just some typography tricks you can create more visual interest in your images and they&#8217;ll look more professional at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>You can also create photo collages with Canva. For this, go to Elements, choose &#8220;Grids&#8221; and select the layout you want.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1917\" src=\"http:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/create-canva-template.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/create-canva-template.jpg 690w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/create-canva-template-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/create-canva-template-600x385.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Next, go to &#8220;Free Photos&#8221; and choose photos for your collage. You can use these free photos for your backgrounds as well.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1918\" src=\"http:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/add-photos-to-instagram-post.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"438\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/add-photos-to-instagram-post.jpg 690w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/add-photos-to-instagram-post-300x190.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/add-photos-to-instagram-post-600x381.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can also create templates and save them to be used later for similar posts.<\/p>\n<p><b>Bonus Tip<\/b>: You can invest some time and create 50 or 100 Instagram posts like these, save them in a Dropbox folder and choose this folder in your JARVEE campaigns as a source with the &#8220;Monitor Folder&#8221; feature. This way when you will have new Instagram posts added to this folder, they will be automatically added to your campaign and shared on your Instagram account.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To be successful on Instagram, you really need to up your graphic design game and create professional looking images.
