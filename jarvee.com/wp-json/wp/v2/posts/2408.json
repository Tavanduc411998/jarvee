In short, they can talk about anything or anyone. They can ask questions, lodge complaints, and even give praise. These days, customers communicate with brands via social media more than any other medium. Therefore, companies and brands must listen carefully to what\u2019s being said online.<\/p>\n<p>Social media listening (or social media monitoring) means identifying and assessing what people are saying about you, your product, company, or brand online. Billions of conversations happen daily, and when you know what\u2019s being said about your company or brand, you can make wise business decisions. The objective of social listening isn\u2019t to know what people are saying about you, it is to act on what they are saying. Many social media marketers assume that social monitoring means focusing on metrics. However, metrics are just a part of the equation. <\/p>\n<p>Social listening gives you a deeper insight into customers, competitors, and influencers. But in order to optimize social media listening, you need to monitor social networks. Getting insights takes time, and you have to use the right tools. Here are 4 amazing tools for social media monitoring.<\/p>\n<h3>4 Must-Have Social Listening Tools<\/h3>\n<h3>#1 Google Alerts<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/googlealerts.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1350\" height=\"270\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2609\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/googlealerts.png 1350w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/googlealerts-300x60.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/googlealerts-768x154.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/googlealerts-1024x205.png 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/googlealerts-600x120.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1350px) 100vw, 1350px\" \/><br \/>\nOne of Google\u2019s less popular gems, this <b>free tool<\/b> generates results based on the keywords you provide and sends them via email. Many marketers and businesses depend on these alerts to learn more about their products and competitors. You can also use Google Alerts to keep track of interesting topics, trends, and any news on the web. <\/p>\n<p>To start using the service, enter the keyword you\u2019d like to receive alerts on. A sample of your alert will appear. After you enter a valid email address, Google will send the results. You can choose the sources you would like to search from, how frequently you would like to receive results and the search volume. You can use Google Alerts to maximize your brand, sales, and traffic. It is easy to set up.<\/p>\n<h3>#2 Mention<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/mention.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1904\" height=\"1214\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2610\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/mention.png 1904w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/mention-300x191.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/mention-768x490.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/mention-1024x653.png 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/mention-600x383.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1904px) 100vw, 1904px\" \/><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/mention.com\/en\/\">Mention<\/a> is a tool designed to search the web and find conversations about your brand.
