					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m very interested in the &quot;&quot;Improve your SEO with Google Plus&quot;&quot; part, I just started a blog focusing on less competitive french keywords. I chose french because there isn&#039;t lot of competitors like in English.

I didn&#039;t know that Google really likes social signals coming for Google Plus. Thank you very much for sharing these valuable tips with us.]]></description>

You can definitely do both, promote on more social platforms for a higher reach and share the same thing on all of them as it will probably reach different people anyway.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I liked the RSS POSTS feature that will automatically grab posts from my wesbite with images and pin them automatically to my pinterest boards with a link back to my website, I used to do that manually and it took a lot of my time :/ I wish I found out about this earlier, I use Jarvee for 2 months already and I never paid attention to it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry but I&#039;m confused a bit. When you say cross-promoting on Social Media, do you mean something like promoting my Facebook page by giving it a shout out in my Twitter account for example? and like that or taking advantage of all social media networks instead of one?]]></description>
