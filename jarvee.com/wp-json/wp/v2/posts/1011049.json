It&#8217;s a great place to drop a few lines to your audience about what you create and why they should engage with your content. One of the most overlooked opportunities within the typical social bio is your link. In this article, we\u2019ll focus on strategies for audience and revenue growth by leveraging your social bio\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p>There are a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designmantic.com\/blog\/20-social-media-tools-small-businesses\/\">plethora of tools<\/a> out there to help influencers and businesses grow and manage their audience, schedule posts, recycle content, and so on. But when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/6-incredible-ways-to-make-money-as-a-social-media-influencer\/\">making money with your audience<\/a>, there is definitely a gap.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s where ad agencies like <a href=\"https:\/\/aanicca.g2afse.com\/click?pid=2525&amp;offer_id=1765&amp;sub1=jarblog\">AdsFluence<\/a> fit in. They typically cater to Influencers with a social following of 10k or greater, on a single social network. Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube influencers are particularly successful since these ad agencies leverage links in your social profiles to earn revenue.<\/p>\n<h3>How does it work?<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1011053\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/How-it-works.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"438\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/How-it-works.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/How-it-works-300x211.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/How-it-works-600x421.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Just like many social profile link tools (<em>biolinks<\/em>), these ad agencies use a microsite or mobile web page for you to display your links, along with links to products or services, downloadable content like games or utilities. Some agencies will provide video feeds on this page as well.<\/p>\n<p>As an <a href=\"https:\/\/influencermarketinghub.com\/what-is-an-influencer\/\">influencer<\/a>, your role in the process is to send your audience to this page. An engaged audience will be happy to visit a link, if they see the value.<\/p>\n<h3>Setting up your BioLink for success<\/h3>\n<p>Think of this page (your biolink) as your own commercial. It&#8217;s customizable and should reflect you. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/theyec\/2020\/09\/18\/five-easy-ways-to-optimize-your-social-media-profiles\/\">You\u2019re the brand<\/a> that is delivering the audience to this page, so it should be familiar to the user.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a Profile picture that matches your social account, that way they know it&#8217;s you.<\/li>\n<li>Add all your social networks no matter how large or small. This helps you \u201ccross-pollinate\u201d your audience<\/li>\n<li>If you blog, have a website, or publish video content, there is usually an option for you to add your own URL, and showcase your content outside of your main social network. This also adds considerable klout to an influencer as it shows to the audience that they are real and invested in themselves as a business.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>How to Profit from a BioLink &#8211; Making Money &#8211; The fun part<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1011055\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/How-to-Profit-from-a-Bio-Link-Making-Money-The-fun-part.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/How-to-Profit-from-a-Bio-Link-Making-Money-The-fun-part.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/How-to-Profit-from-a-Bio-Link-Making-Money-The-fun-part-300x216.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/How-to-Profit-from-a-Bio-Link-Making-Money-The-fun-part-600x432.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So you\u2019ve got a great-looking BioLink, full of amazing value for your viewers. All that&#8217;s left is to put it to use.<\/p>\n<p>IMPORTANT &#8211; Add your BioLink everywhere you can. Unfortunately, not all platforms will let you add a bio link, so you&#8217;ll need to login and check. If there is a spot to put a website URL within your social profile, that&#8217;s where you will want to place your biolink. It&#8217;s your website about you.<\/p>\n<h3>Why is it important?<\/h3>\n<p>First, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/04\/30\/how-much-money-you-can-make-off-social-media-following-calculator.html\">that&#8217;s where you make your money<\/a>. Your BioLink hosts great ad campaigns, free apps, and other opportunities for your audience to take advantage of, and for you to earn a commission on.<\/p>\n<p>Second, the ad agencies collect statistical data as your followers visit your BioLink, and take advantage of these opportunities. This data is used to provide valuable feedback to these agencies about how their campaigns perform with your audience. The agency\u2019s job is to maximize your earnings, and this is what they use to do it, so the more activity the better.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, building historical activity ensures that you are capable of providing a consistent stream of viewers to your BioLink. Agencies love consistency because it\u2019s predictable, which is great when agencies have large budgets to fill or really great campaigns. It&#8217;s these influencers who have built up a history, that will get those campaigns<\/p>\n<h3>Send those followers to your link<\/h3>\n<p>Sounds pretty easy, and honestly, it is, once you\u2019ve picked up simple techniques you can use to encourage your followers to go to your link and perform the actions you want them to. Actions that will result in the best earnings, and provide the best data.<\/p>\n<p>Review what types of promotions your ad agency has available to you, and find ways to incorporate them into your content. Be real about it. For example, if you have the opportunity to promote an app, try installing it, did it meet your expectations? If so, tell people. Most people will make a decision based on a referral or recommendation compared to any other promotional method, so give it a try.<\/p>\n<p>Use your BioLink as a bridge that connects your content together. For example, make a quick Instagram story from a much longer video you\u2019ve posted on YouTube, then add the YouTube video as a custom URL in your BioLink.\u00a0 Your Instagram story should send the audience to your BioLink, where they can find a link to your full-length video, along with some great ad campaigns.<\/p>\n<h3>Get creative and test test test<\/h3>\n<p>This will be a little different for everyone, but your agency should be able to provide you with tips based on their experience. If your agency provides you with an account manager, become their best friend. They know everything about what campaigns work where, and sometimes have access to campaigns you wouldn&#8217;t find on their platform.<\/p>\n<p>Be prepared to test out a few things to see what really works. And keep the communication channels open. <em>Your account manager will want to help you succeed<\/em> just as much as you do. Make them a part of your team.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes it can be as simple as asking your audience to do something like fill in a form or install an app, and boom!! Your earnings skyrocket. Such actions could also be incorporated into contests where you challenge users to install an app and get to a certain level, or install an app to qualify for the contest. So start simple, be consistent, and test test test.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Author<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/michaelstimson\/\">Michael Stimson<\/a> is a digital marketing expert, and former Ad Agency CEO.
