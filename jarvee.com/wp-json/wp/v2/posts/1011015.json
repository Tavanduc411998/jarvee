The thing is that other brokerages are probably looking to hire the same people; thus, you need to step up your efforts if you want to stand out.<\/p>\n<p>A good way to do this is to boost your social media recruiting, especially if you\u2019re looking to hire up-and-coming agents. Considering how popular social media platforms have grown and continue to grow, your brokerage would be remiss if you don\u2019t tap its potential. The size of the talent pool alone is an opportunity that you can\u2019t afford to miss.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to make the most of social media recruiting, or if you\u2019re planning on refining your current strategies, here are some best practices to keep in mind:<\/p>\n<h3>Be In the Right Spaces<\/h3>\n<p>There are plenty of social media channels nowadays and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbescoachescouncil\/2021\/03\/09\/top-five-social-media-platforms-for-business-leaders\/?sh=3c445f1a7e07\">each one has its own unique benefits<\/a> when it comes to real estate recruitment. This means that you can\u2019t apply the same tactics across all platforms. For example, Facebook allows you to create Groups; this is an excellent way to increase engagement and cultivate a community. Meanwhile, LinkedIn acts as both a job board and a professional network-building site. As such, it\u2019s the perfect place for corporate recruitment.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Twitter is great for amplification. You can take advantage of trending topics and craft shareable tweets that can bring more visits to your website. You can also share your job postings on Twitter, but don\u2019t make it your main recruitment platform since it\u2019s literally designed for \u201cin the moment\u201d content.<\/p>\n<h3>Use the Right Tools<\/h3>\n<p>To make your social media recruitment more seamless and efficient, it\u2019s best to invest in the right technological tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/getbrokerkit.com\/home\/a-day-in-the-life-real-estate-recruiting-ideas\/\">real estate CRM. Get Brokerkit<\/a> for a CRM software that allows you to automate social media profile lookups, thus minimizing the time you spend looking for candidates. The same software also allows you to import leads from other sources, capture leads from landing pages and APIs, as well as segment leads using various attributes.<\/p>\n<p>The key thing to remember is that recruitment deals with a lot of data. By utilizing the right tools, you can make sense of all the information and thus arrive at the most ideal hiring decisions.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1011017\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Take-Note-of-Relevant-Topics-and-Hashtags.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"626\" height=\"626\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Take-Note-of-Relevant-Topics-and-Hashtags.png 626w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Take-Note-of-Relevant-Topics-and-Hashtags-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Take-Note-of-Relevant-Topics-and-Hashtags-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Take-Note-of-Relevant-Topics-and-Hashtags-600x600.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Take Note of Relevant Topics and Hashtags<\/h3>\n<p>People talk about different things on social media, and the topics of interest change every day. Usually, they\u2019re related to special events or occasions (like, say, the Super Bowl or Thanksgiving). There are also recurring hashtags, such as #ThrowbackThursday or #FlashbackFriday. Of course, you don\u2019t have to \u201cride\u201d or hijack all of these trending topics and hashtags. Rather, you need to <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/use-hashtags-facebook-twitter-g-pinterest-instagram\/\">determine which ones are the most relevant<\/a> to your goals.<\/p>\n<p>For real estate recruiting, consider adding #realestate and #realestatejobs to your posts. You can also add the location so that those in the area you\u2019re targeting can find your posts faster.<\/p>\n<h3>Get Straight to the Point<\/h3>\n<p>Admittedly, social media platforms are full of clutter. On Facebook and Instagram alone, there are hundreds of millions of photos being uploaded every day. In short, it can be difficult to get noticed.<\/p>\n<p>This is why you should get straight to the point and say what you mean. This is particularly true if you\u2019re targeting the younger generation of real estate agents, who grew up with the internet and social media. They\u2019re exposed to hundreds of ads daily and they don\u2019t want to waste time trying to figure out what you\u2019re trying to say. <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/12-powerful-content-marketing-ideas-in-2022\/\">Keep things short and simple<\/a> yet bold to catch their attention.<\/p>\n<h3>Try Direct Messages, But Sparingly<\/h3>\n<p>Almost all social media platforms nowadays have built-in messaging functions. There are also a lot of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tomsguide.com\/best-picks\/best-chat-apps\">messaging apps<\/a>, all of which can help you facilitate a more direct conversation with potential candidates. Of course, be conscientious about contacting your leads this way. Some may be okay with it, while others may prefer email or other modes of communication.<\/p>\n<p>Even with their express approval, make sure not to bombard candidates with hourly messages. Those who are actively applying may be more forgiving (they want to stay updated about their application, after all), but you should still be mindful of the frequency of your communique.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1011018\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Try-Direct-Messages.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"460\" height=\"460\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Try-Direct-Messages.png 626w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Try-Direct-Messages-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Try-Direct-Messages-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Try-Direct-Messages-600x600.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Link Back to Your Brokerage\u2019s Site<\/h3>\n<p>What\u2019s great about social media recruiting is that it presents a dual opportunity. You won\u2019t just be able to find top-notch real estate agents, you\u2019ll also be able to promote your brokerage. Thus, it\u2019s a good idea to maximize your job postings.<\/p>\n<p>Remember when interested candidates click on your ads, they\u2019re likely going to look for more information about your company as well. Include relevant links, such as the brokerage\u2019s own social media page (if you\u2019re posting on a separate recruitment account) and website. Ultimately, this will help build your reputation and bolster your social recruiting campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Last but certainly not least, measure your social media recruitment performance. In particular, pay attention to the time to hire, quality of hires, and the number of applications received through your social ads. This way, you can determine which among your campaigns are the most effective and make changes to those that aren\u2019t yielding desirable results.<\/p>\n<p>Good luck with your real estate agent recruitment efforts!<\/p>\n<h3>About the Author<\/h3>\n<p>Mia Davis is a financial analyst and mentor who is keen on data science and stress management.
