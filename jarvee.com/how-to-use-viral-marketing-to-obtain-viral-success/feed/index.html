					<description><![CDATA[Awesome points! From my experience and other viral marketing campaigns that I noticed through the years the strongest once are those that trigger emotions. When message is showing happiness, sadness, loneliness or similar strong emotions it&#039;s easier for people to relate and understand the message and to share it with others as well.]]></description>

Will have to learn more I guess.  Thank you for sharing this valuable information with us.]]></description>

It started avalanche of posts from other users with the same theme :) On that post she got more than million likes and who knows how many followers, beside that probably some people that didn&#039;t know her before now know who she is.]]></description>
