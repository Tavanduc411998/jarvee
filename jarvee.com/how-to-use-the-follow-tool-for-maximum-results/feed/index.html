Hi Ibrahim,

Nobody can guarantee you won&#039;t get &quot;action required&quot; message again if he&#039;ll keep interacting with the account while it&#039;s also added in Jarvee. You can try setting up night mode during the day, so client can work on its account and Jarvee will work on it during night.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Bruce..

On the same subject. My client has a business account to promote his brand and everything works perfectly so far, but he keeps using his phone to respond to customers comments and inquiries on instagram and this results in action blocks every week. 
I asked him to stop it and he said he cant because that would hurt his brand and this is the whole point behind the IG account, he said he would rather stop my services than stopping responding to customers.
What if i agree with him on a timetable lets say 8am - 4pm he takes control and use the mobile app and then 5pm - 11pm i use jarvee. would that work ? keeping in mind we are not on the same proxy.]]></description>

When using Jarvee, we always suggest to avoid doing any manual work, it&#039;s not necessary and it&#039;s much safer when you don&#039;t use your account on two devices/apps (Jarvee and IG app on phone) at the same time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jarvee.com/how-to-use-the-follow-tool-for-maximum-results/#comment-12906&quot;&gt;Bruce&lt;/a&gt;.

I am interested in this topic too. I am trying Jarvee with Instagram as an automation tool, not as a bot since this is actually dead now.
My plan is using one proxy/vpn per account and connect all my devices by them (Jarvee, mobile, desktop).
I will use Jarvee for repetitive actions: posting, follow/unfollow (filtering followers) and DM to thank likes and comments. Manually: liking, DM, comments, stories and follow (when I will not unfollow).
Is this safe with Jarvee? If not, what are the current options for moving toward automation?
Thank you]]></description>

It&#039;s not recommended, but if you really have to, it&#039;s best to use it only for checking out posts (without doing any actions like following, unfollowing, liking posts).]]></description>
