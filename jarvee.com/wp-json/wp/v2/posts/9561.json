It has a huge number of users, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/1095186\/tiktok-us-users-age\/\">many of which are teens or young adults<\/a>. The app is great for posting funny videos of all kinds from skits, to dances, to sketches, and everything in between. It has launched several careers and is arguably the most popular place for young people to spend time on the internet.<\/p>\n<p>There are also several apps that have integrated with TikTok and several others that help people edit or capture their videos to post on the platform. There is even a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facetuneapp.com\/facetune-video\/tiktok\/\">Facetune retouch app for TikTok<\/a> to ensure all your content and videos look great. But in addition to being great for individuals, Tiktok is also useful for businesses.<\/p>\n<p>If your customers are teens or young adults, there are few better places to reach them than TikTok. Whether you sell a product or service, TikTok can help get your offering in front of the right eyes. But how do you use TikTok for business? Well, is that exactly what this article is going to take a closer look at.<\/p>\n<h2>Learn the Platform<\/h2>\n<p>Before you ever attempt to reach out to your potential customers on TikTok, you need to familiarize yourself with the platform. All social media platforms are different, and TikTok is no exception. It is a much more casual platform than many others and rewards creativity and personal expression more than perfectly buttoned-up content. Don\u2019t attempt to be perfect, and allow yourself to be authentic and vulnerable, as that resonates well on the platform.<\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t take yourself too seriously on TikTok and need to be aware that most of the audience is younger. It is a place to have fun and laugh, and while powerful and emotional content can still succeed, most of TikTok is quite positive in nature. If you try to release videos before you know what TikTok is about, your efforts could fall flat if they don\u2019t line up with what people expect.<\/p>\n<p>Also, you want to learn about the platform behind the scenes. For example, you want to learn <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-to-use-tiktok-pro-analytics-effectively\/\">how to use analytics effectively<\/a>, as it can help your business find more success and make better sense of your results and data.<\/p>\n<h2>Create Your Own Videos<\/h2>\n<p>Once you have learned how TikTok works as a platform, there are a few options for how you can reach out to customers. The first is to simply create your own videos. This involves starting your own page and uploading your own videos to it.<\/p>\n<p>This can be great for maintaining full control of what you post, and can really help your brand to grow. A single viral TikTok or successful growth of your page can help you reach a ton of customers. However, this isn\u2019t always easy. It can be difficult to build up a following, and getting the videos right in terms of editing, visuals, and audio can be challenging, too.<\/p>\n<h2>Work With Other Creators<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9563\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Work-With-Other-Creators.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"416\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Work-With-Other-Creators.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Work-With-Other-Creators-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Work-With-Other-Creators-600x400.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Another option is to work with other creators directly. Influencer marketing allows you to get your product or message out there, without having to create content yourself. The industry is also expected to continue to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grandviewresearch.com\/industry-analysis\/influencer-marketing-platform-market\">grow rapidly in the coming years<\/a>. You will work with a creator to have your product or service mentioned or featured in their video. This can get it in front of a ton of eyes, without you having to do any of the legwork yourself.<\/p>\n<p>While it will get you in front of the right people quickly and with less difficulty, it can <a href=\"https:\/\/influencermarketinghub.com\/influencer-rates\/\">come with a cost<\/a>. This varies, but some large influencers might require a large fee, or may even want a percentage of the business that their post brings in.<\/p>\n<p>Also, be sure you are selective when it comes to the creators or influencers you work with. They need to have fans or an audience that lines up with your target market. If not, you might not get the same reach or exposure you were hoping for.<\/p>\n<h2>Sharing UGC (User-Generated Content)<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to grow your page, but don\u2019t want to put the time into creating your own videos, you can share UGC. User-generated content is content that is created by your users, and either shared directly on your page or simply is discoverable through hashtags. If you post things on your page, and as your page gets more popular, more and more people will show interest in being featured there.<\/p>\n<p>This UGC will feature your products or messaging, but you don\u2019t have to create the content yourself. A great way to do this is with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/business\/en\/blog\/branded-hashtag-challenge-harness-the-power-of-participation\">branded hashtag challenge<\/a> on TikTok, which can get people all over the world to participate in the challenge, while also sharing your message or product.<\/p>\n<p>UGC puts the customer first, and is a clever way to get your product or service in front of people, without it seeming too \u201csalesy\u201d. Of course, be sure to watch out for mistakes related to<\/p>\n<h2>Advertise on the App<\/h2>\n<p>In addition to creating a page of your own, you can simply advertise on the platform. This stops you from having to build an audience and can get your marketing message in front of the right eyes within a day. While advertising on TikTok is still relatively new, it is an increasingly popular way for businesses to use TikTok to achieve success.<\/p>\n<p>In general, there are a few different ways to advertise on the platform. You can have in-feed ads, branded hashtags, Top View ads, brand takeovers, and even branded lenses for people to put over their content. Each can help spread your message to the masses, and allow you to reach out to the correct subset of the TikTok population.<\/p>\n<p>Feel free to try out a few of them before you decide which is right for you. The costs of each will vary, so be sure to do some research beforehand and make sure the option you choose is right for your goals or expectations.<\/p>\n<p>By using the tips and information in this article, you will be able to successfully reach your customers on TikTok. While you may not find success overnight, if you learn the platform and use a strategy that works for you, you can certainly make TikTok an important part of your marketing.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Author<\/h3>\n<p>Kyla Stewart is a former content writer, who decided to start her own blogging site and become a digital nomad.
