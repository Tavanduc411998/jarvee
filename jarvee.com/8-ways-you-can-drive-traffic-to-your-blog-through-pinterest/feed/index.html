					<description><![CDATA[Definitely people should create more original content on Pinterest, since even when I do some research about some topic, I come across many same images. This is fine, since It&#039;s how Pinterest works, but if you want to stand out and drive more traffic, create your own original content.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jarvee,

Many people forget about the last tip on your list. Not adding a call to action is a missed opportunity to get someone to visit your blog. CTAs are vital in all kinds of business, and you can see them even on TV ads. Every marketer knows that without a clear call-to-action, no one knows what exactly you want them to do. They may repin your post, but what if you wanted them click on a link? Unless you have a CTA, they wouldn&#039;t know what action to take next.

Thank you for a great piece!]]></description>
