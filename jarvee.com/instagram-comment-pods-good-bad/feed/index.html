					<description><![CDATA[I joined a pod while ago, it wasn&#039;t that interesting. You are obligated to comment in stuff you might like or not like and you gotta leave a positive feedback even if the post isn&#039;t that good. It was a lot of work and doing something I didn&#039;t like.

Now, I just engage with my followers content that I really like and I invest my time into creating top quality content for my followers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really don&#039;t feel good about these pods especially if you are getting sponsored by brands, they are paying you based on the engagement you get and when using those pods you are cheating those brands.

The problem is, once you start it there&#039;s no way you can stop because your engagement will go down to hell. I would advice influencers to stay out of it.]]></description>

It can take as much as you allow it to take, give it a try and if it&#039;s too much for you there&#039;s time to reconsider :)]]></description>
