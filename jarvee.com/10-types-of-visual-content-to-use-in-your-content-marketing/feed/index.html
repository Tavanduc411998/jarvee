					<description><![CDATA[You can also use GIF&#039;s as visual content! This kind of content is short and sweet. It&#039;s great when it&#039;s funny and when users can easily relate to the situation. :) Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not just about the video. The visuals and the story of the video should be stimulating feelings inside the audience. If you&#039;ve seen big brands advertisements you&#039;ll note that they ALWAYS form the video to induce emotions.]]></description>
