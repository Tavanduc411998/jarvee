					<description><![CDATA[A great tip that I would mention is to create videos that are optimized for multiple social networks. This wouldn&#039;t be easy since every social network requires different formats, but this would save you money and your content would keep the same identity through social networks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love this post! It&#039;s true to remain relevant and hip in 2019 you are very wise to include video in your promotions, blog and website. And there are so many channels that make it super easy to post a good video without being an expert.  I love a good roundup of experienced bloggers to brainstorm from! Thank you for posting this informative and helpful &#039;evergreen&#039; post!]]></description>
