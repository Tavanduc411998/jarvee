The video-sharing feature allows you to share and connect with your followers and potential clients\/customers in an authentic and engaging way.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/robertadams\/2016\/05\/15\/how-to-build-a-business-on-instagram-advice-from-the-million-plus-followers-club\/?sh=12d9d87b3c0c\">successful Instagram profile<\/a> can be the ticket to success for many product and service-based businesses. We\u2019re existing in an age when people want to know the faces behind the brands they\u2019re buying from. Instagram\u2019s diverse social features are still one of the most popular ways of connecting and consuming in the modern world. In addition to this, Instagram has become a hub for online advertisement, meaning consumers are frequently buying through advertising or interaction with items and services they\u2019ve seen on the app.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst Instagram does have the power to transform your business, developing a successful Instagram strategy isn\u2019t easy. Many businesses and brands don\u2019t utilize the app to its full potential. We\u2019re continuously seeing brands post sporadic feed posts whilst neglecting the other features the social media platform offers. This results in lower engagement and decreased visibility. As a result of this, these brands aren\u2019t gaining the awareness and profitability they set out to achieve on the app.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a business in 2021, IGTV needs to be a valued part of your Instagram strategy.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, we\u2019re outlining the 5 ways to use IGTV to grow your business in 2021. We don\u2019t want you to be one of those businesses neglecting Instagram&#8217;s features and stunting your gram growth as a result.<\/p>\n<h2>#1 Reposting and Repurposing<\/h2>\n<p>Repost and repurpose need to be your mantra for the forthcoming year. By doing these two things, you&#8217;ll be able to produce more content and not have to sacrifice the quality.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s an age-old debate between quality and quantity, but the truth is, you need both. To grow a successful business Instagram account, you need to be producing high-quality content consistently. This is because clients want to see a level of professionalism (quality), and they need to see it often (quantity). There&#8217;s no use popping up on someone&#8217;s Instagram feed now and then. If you want to grow as a business, you need to keep showing up and showcasing your product or service.<\/p>\n<p>Showing up consistently is the only way to stick in a customer&#8217;s mind. Your ideal customer likely follows hundreds, if not thousands of similar accounts. How do you expect to stand out, stay in their minds, AND be promoted by the algorithm? We can tell you how: IGTV.<\/p>\n<p>By repurposing old content, e.g. YouTube videos, putting together reel complications, maybe even a podcast recording, you&#8217;re going to be putting out high-quality content with minimum effort.<\/p>\n<p>Repurposing and reposting old content onto IGTV is how you find the sweet spot between quality and quantity. Showing up on IGTV will increase your brand visibility, show customers your dedication, and help you climb up the algorithm.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram wants you to use all its features! Spread your content across all of Instagram&#8217;s features and take advantage of the numerous ways your brand message can be shared and showcased.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8143 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/video-content-instagram.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/video-content-instagram.jpeg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/video-content-instagram-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/video-content-instagram-768x512.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/video-content-instagram-600x400.jpeg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>#2 Create A Content Series<\/h2>\n<p>Another way to keep up with consistent IGTV output is by serialising your content. Serialising takes more work than simply repurposing, but this time can be a worthy investment.<\/p>\n<p>Use your IGTV to create a series of videos exploring, explaining, or telling something. Hook your watcher in, but make sure not to reveal the whole story in your first episode.<\/p>\n<p>For example, tell your watchers how you began your business. Make this story fun and engaging. The most important thing is to not tell the whole story in one episode. Cut this into chunks and leave each episode on a cliffhanger. Their desire for a resolution will have them coming back and tuning in to the next IGTV you post.<\/p>\n<p>Producing a content series results in several high-quality pieces of content, it provides more information to your potential customer and shows your viewers you\u2019re a dedicated brand that values their visibility.<\/p>\n<p>Tip: To not lose momentum and exhibit the same levels of enthusiasm across all episodes in the series, film them all at once. Set aside time to film the whole IGTV series and edit them down into smaller pieces of content later.<\/p>\n<h2>#3 Give Tutorials<\/h2>\n<p>One of 2021s biggest social media trends is content that informs. Your content should be educational to your reader. Those tuning in to your IGTV want to learn something they didn&#8217;t know beforehand. Educational content will resonate most with your watcher and encourage them to come back for more.<\/p>\n<p>One easy way to provide this education is through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techsmith.com\/blog\/instructional-videos\/\">a tutorial<\/a>. Tutorials are informal and engaging. These are especially beneficial to businesses that can showcase their products or services.<\/p>\n<p>An IGTV allows you to go into depth about what your product does and how it&#8217;ll enrich your viewer\u2019s life. The length of an IGTV (compared to a reel or post) enables you to go into detail and simultaneously sell to and inform your viewer.<\/p>\n<h2>#4 Q&amp;A Sessions<\/h2>\n<p>We&#8217;re seeing an increasing desire for consumers to know the people and the ethos behind the businesses they buy from. <a href=\"https:\/\/uplandsoftware.com\/altify\/resources\/blog\/people-buy-from-people\/\">People buy from people<\/a>, and features like IGTV allow you to exploit this consumer habit.<\/p>\n<p>The simplest way for people to learn about your business is through a Q&amp;A session. A Q&amp;A puts the buyer in control and enables them to learn everything they want to know about your business. The more transparent and approachable you are regarding the questions they ask, the more likely they are to invest in you and your business!<\/p>\n<p>Whilst you can do Q&amp;A sessions on your stories, or even on a grid post, IGTV facilitates the professionalism and longevity you should have on a business account. You want your clients or customers to easily access the information they want to know, not have to go searching for it in a jumble of story archives.<\/p>\n<p>A designated IGTV shows efficiency and enables you to curate important questions you want your buyers to know the answers to.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8145 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/showcase-new-products.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/showcase-new-products.jpeg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/showcase-new-products-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/showcase-new-products-768x512.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/showcase-new-products-600x400.jpeg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>#5 Showcase New Products<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re a product or service-based business, you can use your IGTV to showcase new products. If you&#8217;re a product-based brand, show your consumers products that are coming out soon. Doing this before the launch builds momentum and anticipation. If you&#8217;re offering a new service, outline what this service will be in detail and explain how your service can benefit your audience.<\/p>\n<p>IGTV allows you to go into detail, utilise this and explain every possible benefit of your product or service! If there\u2019s a particular way your product should be used, share this with your viewers. For example, if you\u2019re a beauty brand bringing out a new piece of make-up, give your viewers a detailed tutorial on how best to use this product. Showcase this product by integrating it into your usual makeup routine. You want to share with your viewer how this item can be an asset to them and how it&#8217;s going to enrich their lives if they invest in it.<\/p>\n<p>Bringing your product to life through IGTV helps the customer envisage this product in their own lives. In addition to this, as mentioned previously, consumers want to buy from people. Authentically sharing your own experiences with a product is a great sales tactic. Seeing a human face promoting a product or service builds trust. This trust is what converts to sales!<\/p>\n<p>One of the biggest benefits of doing this on IGTV is that you can have a swipe up link. A swipe up link is the ideal <a href=\"https:\/\/www.optimizely.com\/uk\/optimization-glossary\/call-to-action\/\">call to action<\/a>. Consumer action is fast-paced and short-lived. People tend to decide if they&#8217;re going to buy something in the first few seconds of being introduced to it. You want your product to stick in their mind up until they purchase it. This is why a swipe up is so effective; your viewers won\u2019t have to seek out your product later, it&#8217;s right there for them to buy in the moment!<\/p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>If you own a business in 2021, IGTV needs to be a valued part of your social media strategy. IGTV produces long-form, engaging content that has longevity and can help you communicate clearly to your consumer. Unlike other social features, IGTV can be used for an array of things. This diversity means you can produce several different IGTV&#8217;s that will benefit your business and encourage sales.<\/p>\n<p>Many businesses are overlooking the benefits of regularly engaging with IGTV. Other businesses neglecting the feature means you&#8217;re likely to stand out. Whilst other businesses are abandoning this useful <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/instagram-marketing-7-tips-improving-instagram-engagement\/\">engagement<\/a> tool, you can produce high-quality content that won&#8217;t get lost in a sea of oversaturation.<\/p>\n<p>Using IGTV shows you value the content you produce and want to provide as much useful information to your potential clients as possible.<\/p>\n<p>IGTV is a practical and easy way to provide your potential clients and customers with the information they need. 2021s business market is dependent on people. People are increasingly buying from people-led brands. This marketing trend means the more you showcase the passionate personalities behind your brand, the better your business will perform.<\/p>\n<p>This blog post has outlined 5 simple ways you can use IGTV to promote and grow your business in 2021.
