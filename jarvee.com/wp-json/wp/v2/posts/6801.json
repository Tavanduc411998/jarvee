On Facebook, Instagram, Twitter \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/4-ways-to-use-linkedin-video-for-your-business\/\">even LinkedIn<\/a>! Audiences are tuning in to discover how much they love to watch the \u2018B-side\u2019 of their favorite brands.<\/p>\n<p>But streaming is not just a passing trend. It\u2019s one of the most engaging types of online content there is, right up there with podcasts and animated <a href=\"https:\/\/breadnbeyond.com\/explainer-videos\/\">explainer videos<\/a>. And if brands want to stay current and to engage with their audience, they should consider jumping on the bandwagon ASAP!<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, today it\u2019s super easy to conduct a broadcast. Since all platforms want in, they\u2019ve made it easy for everyone to broadcast at any given time! But just because anyone can broadcast, it doesn\u2019t mean that everyone knows how to do it <em>right<\/em>. So, today, we\u2019ll go through the basics of how to conduct a successful live stream!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6802\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/7-Steps-to-Making-Live-Videos-that-Further-Your-Branding.jpg\" alt=\"7 Steps to Making Live Videos that Further Your Branding\" width=\"602\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/7-Steps-to-Making-Live-Videos-that-Further-Your-Branding.jpg 602w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/7-Steps-to-Making-Live-Videos-that-Further-Your-Branding-300x168.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/7-Steps-to-Making-Live-Videos-that-Further-Your-Branding-600x337.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Before the Broadcast<\/h2>\n<p>Every video begins with a solid strategy, even Live ones. So, before you even hit that \u201cplay\u201d button you need to know that everything\u2019s on check: you\u2019ve double-checked that your equipment works, you know the ins-and-outs of setting up a live stream on the platform of your choosing, and you\u2019ve got a solid topic you can talk about at length!<\/p>\n<p>So, let\u2019s explore those elements in a bit more detail, shall we?<\/p>\n<h3>Source Content from Your Audience<\/h3>\n<p>You want to stream, but you don&#8217;t know what to talk about? Don&#8217;t worry \u2014 your audience does!<\/p>\n<p>Your audience knows what they are interested in, and the best way to deliver content that\u2019s valuable to them is by asking about what they want to learn! Run polls, ask people about what they want you to speak about through social media, or create themes based on frequent topics or questions from the community.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to get people excited about a topic is to let them pick it! Analyzing your audience and what they want will also give you a hint of <em>where<\/em> you should conduct your live event \u2014 choose the platform where your audience prefers to be.<\/p>\n<h3>Double-Check the Basic Technical Details!<\/h3>\n<p>A lot of potentially good live videos end up failing. The reason? Something perfectly avoidable \u2014 bad lighting, sound problems, connection, or stability issues\u2026 But yours won\u2019t suffer these setbacks because you\u2019re smart enough to check all the technical details before you go Live!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Light: <\/strong>Choose lights that highlight your face without burning your image. There are plenty of professional and semi-professional lights that you can find online at affordable prices. Otherwise, choose a room with lots of natural light.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sound<\/strong>: The best option is a lavalier mic (the ones that you clip on to your shirt). These mics are hand-free and are designed to receive the sound directly from your mouth while filtering ambient sound. If you can\u2019t get one of these, at least make sure that your audio is coming across loud and clear, and that you\u2019re in a quiet environment with the least possible ambient noise.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Internet<\/strong>: A fast and steady Internet connection is essential. Lots of great live streams come to an early end because of the connection failing! And you can bet you audience won\u2019t stick around too long after that.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you take care of these three technical factors, it won\u2019t matter if you\u2019re filming from a professional camera or your iPhone \u2014 your live stream\u2019s basics will be under control.<\/p>\n<h3>Promote Your Event Ahead of Time<\/h3>\n<p>You can\u2019t just start a Livestream out of the blue and expect people to tune in. Sure, <em>some <\/em>may do it, but you\u2019ll be losing most of your potential audience just because you didn\u2019t bother to let them know in advance.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t make that mistake; promote your stream. Use social media posts detailing the time and date of the event, or create interactive stories encouraging people to leave their questions or topic suggestions for the live stream. You can schedule a live event on platforms like YouTube or Facebook as well to build anticipation.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever you do, just remember: promote, promote, promote.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6803\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/promote-promote-promote.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/promote-promote-promote.jpg 602w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/promote-promote-promote-300x168.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/promote-promote-promote-600x337.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>During the Broadcast<\/h2>\n<p>Time to hit that Live button! Just don\u2019t let your guard off just yet: it\u2019s important to know how to behave during a broadcast to attract your viewer\u2019s attention and <strong>keep it<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h3>Offer Context Constantly<\/h3>\n<p>Your common sense tells you that it\u2019s a good idea to introduce yourself and your company at the beginning of your video broadcast. That\u2019s how it happens in most online content, right?<\/p>\n<p>Well, while this can be true for blog posts and podcasts, it\u2019s not for live videos. Broadcasting platforms allow visitors to join a stream at any moment, so every once in a while, you\u2019ll need to reintroduce yourself and tell a bit of context about what\u2019s happening.<\/p>\n<h3>Engage with Your Audience<\/h3>\n<p>When used correctly, live videos are a fantastic tool to engage with your audience because it&#8217;s a format that feels more like a two-way conversation than any other one.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure to conduct this conversation naturally by responding to the comments that appear live on air. This will invite more people to share their thoughts and opinions as you go along! Interacting with your viewers will help boost engagement and keep them coming back to your future shows for more \u2013 a common practice used by the best <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yumyumvideos.com\/the-top-10-animated-video-production-companies-wp\/\">video production companies<\/a> out there that you should try to emulate!<\/p>\n<p>Another part of engaging with your audience is to look right at them. Just like in real-life conversations \u2014 eye-contact is vital! So, try your best to look at the camera when you\u2019re speaking, not at the phone screen or monitor (&#8230; unless you\u2019re a gaming streamer, in which case, maybe you <em>should<\/em> be looking at the monitor).<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6804\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Engage-with-Your-Audience.jpg\" alt=\"Engage with Your Audience\" width=\"602\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Engage-with-Your-Audience.jpg 602w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Engage-with-Your-Audience-300x168.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Engage-with-Your-Audience-600x337.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>After the Broadcast<\/h2>\n<p>No, we\u2019re not over yet! Just like with any other marketing video, there\u2019s some post-production that needs to be done, even if it looks a bit different for live videos. Let\u2019s take a look!<\/p>\n<h3>Analyze the Results<\/h3>\n<p>Most marketing strategies are based on creating content, analyzing the result of the audience, and improving the content until it meets the campaign\u2019s goals. Live video is not the exception \u2014 analyzing the results of your broadcast will give you the data that you need to keep optimizing your future live events!<\/p>\n<p>On platforms like YouTube and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/facebookmedia\/blog\/introducing-new-metrics-for-live-video\">Facebook Live<\/a>, you can see certain metrics for live videos that are very interesting to keep track of. For example, you can see the total number of people who watched at least a portion of the video and a count of how many viewers you had at different points in time \u2014 with this information in your hands, you can understand the topics that were most interesting to your audience.<\/p>\n<p>The more you learn about your viewer preferences, the likelier you are to create stronger videos in the future, so don\u2019t give up!<\/p>\n<h3>Share It Everywhere!<\/h3>\n<p>Live broadcasts are generally not the most polished productions, and sometimes brands get self-conscious of leaving their live videos public on their pages forever. But doing it can be super useful to get to the audience that wasn\u2019t able to attend the event in the first place!<\/p>\n<p>A smart thing to do is to download the video, edit it (trim it up a little, make sure it looks more polished, add branded elements like nametags and logos) and then upload it to your regular channels.<\/p>\n<p>And when you do it, share it everywhere! Locate specific groups of people on Facebook that share an interest in the topic that you talked about, and spread the word about your newly uploaded stream. Or upload it to your IGTV \u2014 It will make it easier for your audience to share it with their followers!<\/p>\n<p>Just remember that there\u2019s live for your video after the broadcast ends. Let it shine for -at least- a little longer!<\/p>\n<h2>Let\u2019s Wrap It Up!<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019re now ready to create live videos as a part of your branding! Just remember:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure to promote your live stream as much as you can ahead of time.<\/li>\n<li>Take good care of all the technical details!<\/li>\n<li>Engage in an active conversation with your audience, read their comments in real-time!<\/li>\n<li>Take a look at the analytics of your broadcast and keep improving your game!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And, most importantly, just have fun. Live videos are a great way to bring people and brands together because they show the real, natural, and unscripted side of the brand. So take note of that and just be your -awesome- self!<\/p>\n<p>Are you ready to start using live video?<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the author<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6806\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Victor-Blasco.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"147\" height=\"147\" \/>Victor Blasco is an audiovisual designer, video marketing expert, and founder\/CEO of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yumyumvideos.com\/\">explainer video company<\/a> <strong>Yum Yum Videos<\/strong>.
