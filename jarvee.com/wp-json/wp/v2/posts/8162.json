That\u2019s always been true, but it\u2019s even more critical if you are trying to keep your business stable through the COVID-19 pandemic. Countless businesses have had to shutter their doors, either temporarily or for good, but your small business doesn\u2019t have to be one of them.<\/p>\n<p>Companies like Jarvee are providing <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/jarvee-social-media-scheduler-features\/\">affordable and effective tools<\/a> to help your business make it through the rest of the pandemic and beyond. To learn more about Jarvee software and other tech, tools and help for staying afloat during the pandemic, keep on reading through these tips.<\/p>\n<h2>#1 Cut Cost But Not Profits<\/h2>\n<p>For small businesses like yours, surviving the pandemic is all about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zenefits.com\/workest\/11-cost-cutting-ideas-for-small-businesses\/\">saving your bottom line.<\/a> That means finding ways to\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fylehq.com\/expense-management-software\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">control and optimize business spend<\/a>\u00a0without cutting into the needs or profits of your business. Sounds pretty stressful right? Well, it really doesn\u2019t have to be!<\/p>\n<p>With a few simple and painless changes, you can subtract your operating expenses without subtracting from your overall ability to survive the pandemic. One of the top recommendations? Give up your physical office space and transition your team to remote work. Not only will this save money, but it\u2019s also much safer. There are also <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/remote-work-tools\">plenty of tools<\/a> to help with the transition.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8173 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/remote-work.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/remote-work.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/remote-work-300x188.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/remote-work-768x480.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/remote-work-600x375.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re still struggling with business costs, know that help is still available. While more federal funds have yet to be released, your business may <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gofundme.com\/c\/blog\/coronavirus-relief-small-businesses\">qualify for<\/a> financial assistance from your local or state government, or one of the many companies offering grants and loans.<\/p>\n<h2>#2 Save Money With an LLC<\/h2>\n<p>Want another simple way to cut costs? Then hop online and form an LLC if you are thinking about reactivating your business! Even if your business is still up and running, changing the structure is an easy way to save on your taxes and even potential liability claims.<\/p>\n<p>Now we know what you\u2019re thinking: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zenbusiness.com\/llc\/\">how long does it take to register LLC entities<\/a>? If you\u2019re imagining spending hours filling out stacks of paperwork, you may be surprised to learn that there are formation services that allow you to fill out those forms in a matter of minutes. You\u2019ll be saving yourself the time, effort, and extra expense required to have an attorney research and file forms for you.<\/p>\n<h2>#3 Automate Social Media for Less<\/h2>\n<p>Social media is especially important for small businesses right now. It\u2019s one of the only ways you can stay connected with your target audience when so many people are choosing to stay at home. If you\u2019re interested in <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/5-things-you-need-to-know-how-social-media-impact-your-seo\/\">boosting your SEO<\/a> (which you really should be!) regularly posting via social media is also critical. Routine updates can boost brand searches, content reach, and more.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re busy trying to keep your doors open, however, you may not have time to log into each of your accounts and post as often as needed. This is why using automated social media software offered like Jarvee is highly recommended. With Jarvee, you can grow your following, increase online traffic and ensure regular posts at a fraction of the costs of a social media team.<\/p>\n<h2>#4 Find Free Tech Tools for Business<\/h2>\n<p>Jarvee is an amazing tool to help your business ride out the remaining waves of the pandemic. You can even take it for a spin for free for the next five days! In addition to this paid software tool, there are<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fundera.com\/business-accounting\/free-accounting-software\"> other popular programs<\/a> (such as free accounting software) that you can snag at absolutely no cost right now.<\/p>\n<p>Corporations like Microsoft, Google, and Facebook are all offering free tools, software, and tech to help small businesses navigate the most stressful challenges of staying open during the global pandemic. From collaboration to marketing to security, there\u2019s so much available to help you manage the changing needs of your business and maybe even help your profits grow.<\/p>\n<h2>#5 Focus on Digital Security Improvements<\/h2>\n<p>With more businesses operating online and remotely these days, digital security has become <a href=\"https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/security\/blog\/2020\/08\/19\/microsoft-shows-pandemic-accelerating-transformation-cyber-security\/\">more important<\/a> than ever before. Many small businesses are finding it difficult to provide safe and secure data access to their remote teams, along with a variety of other new challenges. 58% are increasing their IT budgets to meet these growing needs, but other small businesses are facing simultaneous pressure to reduce their IT and overall operating expenses.<\/p>\n<p>If your business needs more security but doesn\u2019t have any more room in the budget, know that there are low-cost solutions available. You can use the free security tools mentioned above to ward off attacks and scams. But some of the best ways to DIY <a href=\"https:\/\/www.score.org\/resource\/small-business-guide-cybersecurity\">effective online security <\/a>is to put the proper practice in place and to train your staff around the most recent online threats.<\/p>\n<h2>#6 Try Contactless Options for Customers<\/h2>\n<p>Security is key, but safety is equally important during these uncertain times. Even if you are able to keep your physical doors open to customers, you will need to have the right protocols in place to protect them and your staff from virus risks. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/communication\/toolkits\/business-workplaces.html\">The CDC<\/a> is the best source for current pandemic guidelines as well as free signage and tools to help update your current practices.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8172 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/touch-free-payment.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/touch-free-payment.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/touch-free-payment-300x188.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/touch-free-payment-768x480.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/touch-free-payment-600x375.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A top recommendation from the CDC and other public health experts is to offer as many contactless shopping options as possible. This can include <a href=\"https:\/\/business.nextdoor.com\/local\/resources\/curbside-pickup-101-a-guide-for-local-retailers\">curbside pickup<\/a> if you would like to avoid having people shop inside of your business. If you are going to allow people into your store or restaurant, it\u2019s also a good idea to provide one of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/small-business-owners-see-expanded-use-of-contactless-some-increases-in-sales-during-covid-19-301038612.html\">latest touch-free<\/a> payment options.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>You definitely need to be resilient and strong to maintain a successful business as we weather the rest of this pandemic storm. Just know that you also don\u2019t have to do it all on your own. So many companies and government agencies are stepping up to the plate to provide the support small business owners need right now. You can also manage the risks associated with your business with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thimble.com\/small-business-insurance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">business insurance<\/a>.
