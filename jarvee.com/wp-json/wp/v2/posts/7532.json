You need to work on various elements to achieve this goal.  Some of them include: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Snippets of the content ( Google shows recommendations saying people also searched for)<\/li>\n<li>Google map of your business via Google my business <\/li>\n<li>Website pages and blogs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You need to work in two broad steps, business listing optimization and website optimization. Let us look into each of them: <\/p>\n<h2>Website Optimization for a First-Page Rank <\/h2>\n<p>You need to work on your search engine optimization (SEO). This cannot be done for the whole website at once. Focusing on individual pages is essential. Let us learn how to do it: <\/p>\n<h2>Picking the Right Keywords <\/h2>\n<p>Every business provides a unique solution for which people search on Google. The words relevant to that business solution are called \u201ckeywords\u201d Put yourself in the customer\u2019s shoes and then determine the right keywords. Some examples are: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Carpet Cleaning Stevenage<\/li>\n<li>Makeup Products Discount <\/li>\n<li>Online Kids Wear Amsterdam <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Be sure to select a different set of keywords for every page. In this way, the inner-pages will not compete. You can also use various free <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/free-keyword-research-tools\/\">tools<\/a> like Google Trends, Keyword Sheeter, Keyword Generator, Google Search Console, etc. <\/p>\n<h2>Make it Easier for Google to Scan <\/h2>\n<p>Google ranks billions of web pages and keeps the data stored in an index. When a search query is posted, Google shows the best result from the index. It is, therefore, essential to place keywords in the right place. Here is how you can do it: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Meta Title <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is the title of your website and blog post. Shown in the form of a header, it should include your keyword. <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Meta Description <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It is the short description displayed under your title in the search engine result. It should have a relevant keyword. Create its content in a way that readers get enough idea of what is present on your page. <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Alt Tags <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google can rely on your images and consider them relevant if they have an alternate text. Be sure to add the keyword in your Alt tags. <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>URL <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Since URL displays your domain name, adding a keyword makes it easier for Google to know about your business. Besides this, Google will rely more on your website if you place the same keyword in your Meta title, URL, and Meta description because the URL is displayed in between your title and description. <\/p>\n<h2>Write Informative Content <\/h2>\n<p>Google strictly monitors keyword stuffing; if you stuff your site with keywords, it will get banned immediately. Be sure to write meaningful content and incorporate the keyword in a way that goes well with the flow of words. Never overstuff the content with keywords; keep the limit to 2%. <\/p>\n<h2>Clear and Accurate Location <\/h2>\n<p>Make sure to mention your location and city in your service and contact us page. Also, add a location in your blog posts. In this way, Google can recommend your site in the \u201cnear me\u201d locations. Similarly, Google can pick up your site when people search for your specific industry in a specific area, as local SEO plays a great role in getting your page ranked. <\/p>\n<h2>Mobile Optimization <\/h2>\n<p>Today more searches are done on mobile and tablets rather than laptops and desktops. Thus, your site should be mobile-friendly and responsive. Google relies on websites that are mobile-friendly as they provide ease to the users. You can also use free tools and increase the responsiveness of your site. <\/p>\n<h2>User-Friendly <\/h2>\n<p>Using the right keywords and mobile-optimization is not enough; Google will check your site in terms of user experience too. It should be easy to navigate, have a clear CTA, provide a rapid solution, and serves in the best possible manner. Google looks at every feature before ranking the site. <\/p>\n<h2>Business Listing for a First Page Rank<\/h2>\n<p>Besides the website, your business should be on the top list of the online business directory. Here are a few ways to do it: <\/p>\n<h2>Google My Business Account <\/h2>\n<p>Google My Business Account is helping several local businesses increase their ranking on Google\u2019s search pages. This free account provides exact location, direction, and contact details about your business. Google gets information from both searches as well as maps in creating the local lists of business profiles. Thus, create a business account and keep monitoring it to stay on the top page rank. <\/p>\n<h2>Optimizing Your Business Profile <\/h2>\n<p>Let us now learn to optimize this free business profile: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fill Every Section <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Be sure to provide complete details in every section; none of the parts should be left blank. Complete profiles have a higher probability of getting more clicks. <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use the Same Name <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Be sure that you use the same business name everywhere on the web. Even a slight change in spelling can affect your ranking. Google likes consistency and professionalism. For instance, if you are using the word \u201ccompany,\u201d do not use Co. anywhere in place of it. <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keep Profile Fully Updated <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you do not keep your profile updated, Google will lose trust in your business. Remember, Google wants to provide accurate information to its users. So, even a minute change should be updated.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Get More Reviews <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Use various strategies for getting Google Reviews. Since Google wants to provide the best information, sites having reviews have higher chances of getting a good rank. <\/p>\n<h2>Use Other Directories <\/h2>\n<p>Use directories like Yelp for a business listing. Google relies on Yelp, and it provides more traffic. Thus, when Google observes that the site is getting good traffic, you have higher chances of getting a good rank. Besides this, Google will observe that the site is listed on the popular directory with ample reviews. This will automatically give you a high rank. <\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion <\/h2>\n<p>In short, getting a top rank on Google\u2019s first page is the ultimate aim of every business. Though many paid tools are available, Google relies on the site that adds value to the users. So, make every possible effort in providing ease to prospects. Earn a distinctive online identity, show your contact details, optimize your web pages, provide easy navigation, give exceptional user-experience, list your business on good directories, and keep on getting good Google reviews. <\/p>\n<h2>About Author<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Shaheryar<\/strong> provides ghostwriting and copywriting services.
