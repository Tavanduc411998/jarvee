So, before jumping to share a promotional message to your audience, it is crucial to understand what form advertising fits in. Or, in other words, what connects the worlds of your viewers with specific advertised products and services. Mostly, there is a whole category of distinctive ads that are better to do on Tik Tok and some other ones on YouTube. In order for you to spread awareness about your brand and increase your conversions and sales, you will want to rely on the right media and spend money on advertising there. Here is a breakdown of the dimensions affecting advertising campaign patterns in each of these media.<\/p>\n<h2>More convenient form of content creation<\/h2>\n<h3>Short-form on TikTok<\/h3>\n<p>Tik Tok is undoubtedly an essential platform of every business\u2019s marketing toolkit. If you don\u2019t shoot great advertising videos there having business account type, you\u2019re missing out on getting new leads and increasing your business\u2019 visibility. It is very easy to express your brand identity there in a succinct wise way you would never probably do in traditional media. For example, several <a href=\"https:\/\/moversshakers.co\/tiktok-case-studies\">case studies<\/a> demonstrated how followers quickly get inspired to follow a trend and take action. NYX brand successfully showcased their brand new &#8220;Butter Gloss lip gloss&#8221; by promoting the song of the same name among Tik Tok dance lovers. Or, another story is the Warner Brothers&#8217; advertising of Scooby release that involved a short viral video challenge. Basically, it is like a breath of fresh air in the advertising world that differs in its approach and technique.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/TikTok-Advertising-vs-YouTube-Which-One-is-Better.jpg\" alt=\"TikTok Advertising vs YouTube Which One is Better\" width=\"624\" height=\"416\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/TikTok-Advertising-vs-YouTube-Which-One-is-Better.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/TikTok-Advertising-vs-YouTube-Which-One-is-Better-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/TikTok-Advertising-vs-YouTube-Which-One-is-Better-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Moreover, the question of expenditures on Tik Tok ads is also different in comparison with other media. Tik Tok video content requires less investment, so you won&#8217;t have to spend a dime telling people about your products or services. The only thing needed is knowing how to combine music effects, filters into a short 1-minute video and using video editing software. That&#8217;s it. Respectively, if your aim is to promote something very fast, involve impulsive buyers and develop funky trends, Tik Tok advertising seems to be better in this case. But, what can YouTube offer then?<\/p>\n<h3>Long-form videos on YouTube<\/h3>\n<p>Traditionally, YouTube has become a place of beautiful and effective video production that delivers a wider variety of long promotional and non-commercial videos. It requires higher values and better unique algorithms. Thus, if you aren&#8217;t experienced in any, a good software development company like <a href=\"https:\/\/vironit.com\/\">VironIT<\/a> can always assist you. It is not rocket science to learn the ropes of video production and its further advertising thanks to the diverse digital tools out there. And, as it is always said: &#8220;The ends justify the means&#8221;. At the end of the day, YouTube is a large sharing media that is really worth investing your time and money in, because it is ultimately proclaimed as the most trusted and reliable of all. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/marketing-strategies\/video\/online-video-ad-engagement\/\">The Google&#8217;s report<\/a> will help illustrate this. It is observed that more and more casual YouTube viewers are becoming loyal fans, when a brand connects with them.<\/p>\n<p>It might sound obvious but by uploading longer high-quality videos, there is a bigger chance to keep on top of your target subscribers thoughts on a much long-term foundation. Which is definitely impossible to reach with Tik Tok. Both media allow you to upload, rate, view videos, and subscribe to the channels of various users. However, the matter of your advertising campaign&#8217;s duration is differently affected here and there. So, make sure your aspirations match the specs of these two.<\/p>\n<h2>More authentic platforms for selling and advertising<\/h2>\n<h3>Hour-long seminars, speeches, online classes<\/h3>\n<p>Indeed, YouTube gives one of the most dynamic and flexible advertising opportunities for accounts that rather focus on cognitive than emotional potential as of Tik Tok. You can always be certain the audience finds your ad to be relevant and never intrusive. Why is that? Let&#8217;s not forget that YouTube has started involving ads just a decade ago. It gave people just enough time to reconsider the platform and decide on their preferences. So, no wonder 2 billion users are still actively watching it every single day. In comparison with Tik Tok, it has a more sustainable reputation in the digital market. So, if there is a question where to purchase from, the customer&#8217;s choice will be as clear as day.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, YouTube lets you experiment with different categories, styles, and approaches to find the one that one works best for your business. You can&#8217;t do any long-lasting sessions, workshops, presentations, guides on Tik Tok. And this always sounds as a more authentic thing that YouTube privillegely has and Tik Tok can&#8217;t give you at the moment. Surprisingly affordable advertisement on YouTube can easily combine and go with various video formats you already have on your channel, and open the door for improvement.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/More-authentic-platforms-for-selling-and-advertising.jpg\" alt=\"More authentic platforms for selling and advertising\" width=\"624\" height=\"416\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7481\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/More-authentic-platforms-for-selling-and-advertising.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/More-authentic-platforms-for-selling-and-advertising-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/More-authentic-platforms-for-selling-and-advertising-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Short entertaining videos combined with music, filters, and effects<\/h3>\n<p>Hands down, there is a far better engagement rate when it comes to challenges and hashtags on Tik Tok. Such a format is easy to apply no matter if you are an amateur or professional advertising specialist. Thus, marketers are advised to create popular user-friendly videos that would inspire their followers to join in on the challenge organically. And, as a result, incorporate the branded hashtag, which is an integral part of ad strategy on Tik Tok. If you feel like you are talented, enthusiastic, and technically proficient enough to compile your content in a hashtag challenge page, this platform should be a go-to.<\/p>\n<p>However, it is important to consider how the &#8220;For you&#8221; feed is generated. When you are featuring certain products or services it will most likely be shared upon a limited number of audience who relate and like to just a few types of videos. So, you will need to fight your tooth and nail to interest and catch your followers with new trends (i.e music, filters, effects). The best way to be in a winning position is through managing your Tik Tok account and advertising from influencers to kickstart a new campaign and be on fleek afterwards.<\/p>\n<h2>More target aged audience<\/h2>\n<h3>The realm of Millennials and Generation Z on Tik Tok<\/h3>\n<p>To begin with, the way how content is distributed across the audience on both platforms can substantially change your perception on advertising. Subsequently, monetizing works easier on YouTube presenting itself as the most popular place for entertainment marketing for people of almost every age. But, nevertheless, a bit faster on Tik Tok thanks to nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/datareportal.com\/social-media-users?rq=tiktok\">800 million active users worldwide<\/a> that are hastily catching up with YouTube viewers every new day.<\/p>\n<p>The target audience for the second one is current teens (Generation Z) and partly Millennials. Knowing this, you can set up your mind about advertising, because the right demographics and data have the biggest significance in this case. You should understand what customers you are dealing with. Otherwise, you will gain nothing but poorer awareness campaign and much slower rate as compared to any other platform.<\/p>\n<h3>YouTube audience targeted for any business<\/h3>\n<p>Interestingly enough, most internet users who use YouTube are of almost the same <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/296227\/us-youtube-reach-age-gender\/\">percentages in each age group<\/a>, which means that YouTube can reach the audience that Tik Tok involves and other generations beyond that.<\/p>\n<p>Ensuring that your ads get in front of the right customers and at the right time can mean the whole world of benefits for your business. So, YouTube is undoubtedly very flexible, because it lets you utilize all targeting features for each and every. Obviously, advertising here will be more responsive and lucrative.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>All in all, the choice about a better advertising platform you are going to make is ultimately yours. It is just a matter of what type of videos, content, and audience it is aimed to attract. Count all &#8220;Yes&#8221; and &#8220;No&#8221; of each platform individually and we bet that whichever assumption you make, it will be the right one.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the author<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Mary Byrd<\/strong> is a freelance writer with a combination of analytical mind and creativity.
