Most often, students search for top-notch tips on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/how-to-write-a-research-paper\/\">how to write a research paper<\/a> on the internet.<\/p>\n<p>On the contrary, if it is a blog post, it might be to share your feelings and thoughts.<\/p>\n<p>Likewise, you might be writing content for your website to tell people what you offer, but also with the aim of building your site\u2019s authority and <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/why-getting-customer-reviews-is-important-for-your-business\/\">getting valuable customer reviews<\/a> for your business.<\/p>\n<p>When you have responded to these two key questions, you can answer this question too: \u201cWho is your intended reader?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>No matter what your topic is about, you are writing for a specific audience. Keeping your targeted readers in mind and their reason for reading your content for the very early stage can help you to achieve your writing goals.<\/p>\n<p>Your mentor is going through your assignment to assess your understanding of the topic. Your blog readers are reading your blog to know about what topic you are covering. Similarly, your website followers are reading your content to learn about your products and services.<\/p>\n<h2>Learn the rules of writing<\/h2>\n<p>Every type of writing requires some rules. Before you start your essay or research paper, you must look at the structure and tone used in writing you will do.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/images.unsplash.com\/photo-1580894732930-0babd100d356?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=870&amp;q=80\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/rules-of-writing.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"805\" height=\"536\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>You can notice word selection, sentence, and even paragraph structure used in the type of paper you will write. But the rules remain the same for every single kind of writing.<\/p>\n<p>However, if you do not know how to format your paper, do not panic. You have to research on the internet to find some examples related to your topic.<\/p>\n<p>Formatting your academic paper is crucial. This may include marks for the following elements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Word count<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Formatting and layout<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">MLA referencing<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Writing style<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Spelling, punctuation, and grammar<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Thus, before writing your paper, you need to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.student.unsw.edu.au\/answering-assignment-questions\"> understand assignment questions<\/a> carefully. Avoid skipping the instructions of your mentor.<\/p>\n<p>However, if you do not understand the paper\u2019s question, contact your mentor.<\/p>\n<p>You need to follow specific formatting rules set by your professor.<\/p>\n<h3>Fonts<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Use easy-to-understand and scannable fonts, such as Times New Roman, Calibri, and Arial. Remember, you have to use only one font throughout your paper.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Write black text on white paper and avoid catchy background as it is a formatted piece of writing.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\u00a0Fix 12 font sizes for your paper\u2019s body<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Spacing<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">It would be best if you used a 1.5 wide spacing margin.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">At the end of each paragraph, leave a blank backline.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\u00a0Do not right-justify your paper. Instead, I prefer left-justify.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Heading<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Write bold text for headings<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\u00a0In an essay, you do not need subheadings. On the contrary, report writing requires headlines.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Title page<\/h3>\n<p>You must include a title page in your college assignment. It should include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Title name<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Your name and roll no.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Course number<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\u00a0Assigned date<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Usually, the professional or formal type of writing, the most significant thing is to stick to the rules.<\/p>\n<p>And in conversational forms of writing, like social media posts or emails, sticking to the rules is not a practical approach.<\/p>\n<h2>Use appropriate language to communicate<\/h2>\n<p>Remember, a well-crafted piece of paper is all about communicating your viewpoint effectively. Sometimes, you have to break the rules to communicate your view.<\/p>\n<p>In some situations, using conversational language helps your readers better understand your intended meaning. But you cannot use informal language in academic assignments.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, you use \u201ccoulda\u201d and \u201cwanna\u201d in your daily conversation, but you cannot use these in your research paper. Whereas in blog posts, you can use them.<\/p>\n<h2>Determine the proper structure of your writing<\/h2>\n<p>While looking at the examples to get a custom tone for your paper, copy their structure. You can find hundreds of samples of every piece of writing on the internet. Structure plays a significant role in writing because it highlights how your written text communicates with your readers.<\/p>\n<h2>Map out the writing phase<\/h2>\n<p>It is impossible that you submit your rough draft without making a single mistake. All pieces of writing follow the same pattern:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Brainstorming<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You are not writing at this stage. Instead, you think about aspects you will cover in your writing, how you structure it, and the conclusion you will write.<\/p>\n<p>This is the place where you determine your audience.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Preparing<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is where you start building your paper. You are not writing yet; you are collecting several sources, outlining your writing, and writing down all the main ideas you brainstormed.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Drafting<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now, you are ready to write your paper!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Map-out-the-writing-phase.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"795\" height=\"530\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Flesh out the outline you developed with credible content. Do not worry about making mistakes in the first draft.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Revising<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here is where you make your draft smooth. This is also the place where you check your structure, style and refine your writing.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Proofreading<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Finally, you need to proofread your paper. This is the pro revision stage. Find out all the typos, grammar, and spelling mistakes and fix them.<\/p>\n<h2>How to write<\/h2>\n<p>Are you ready to write your assignment?<\/p>\n<p>Here is where you need to get personal. Some students prefer total silence to focus on their papers. Others cannot concentrate on their assignment with a bit of background music.<\/p>\n<p>Some students open MS Word and write their first draft in one sitting. On the other hand, some students outline, organize and structure their content in a logical sequence.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, it would help if you read what you have written. When you have finished your essay, close the laptop and take some rest.<\/p>\n<p>Give it some time and read it with a fresh look. Why?<\/p>\n<p>When you give yourself some time between the writing and reading phase, you give yourself the best opportunity to recall those ideas that you might not have caught without it.<\/p>\n<p>However, when you do not have appropriate time to sleep on your work, read it according to your time. Reading it with a fresh look is the most effective approach, but reading it with any eye is far better than skipping the reading phase.<\/p>\n<h2>Author&#8217;s Bio<\/h2>\n<p>Nova Addison is the mother of two beautiful young girls, Nova got married to her boyfriend Mark who is an established banker and a qualified accountant.
