hi Wilbert,

I can&#039;t recommend you any specific provider, but I can recommend type of proxies: mobile.
Residential proxies might work well too. Avoid using datacenter proxies, doesn&#039;t matter if they are private or shared.

Regards]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Adam,

Im currently Reading everything I can before I start using Jarvee like a boss! Only question I have is if you could recommend me a good private proxy provider and what type of proxies (residential/mobile) to use with Jarvee?, Thank you very much and looking forward to heard back from you as that is the only thing that I need to know before getting started! 

Thank you very much!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like the idea of this tool, but haven&#039;t been able to fully enjoy it just yet. I thought I had it set up the way it was supposed to, and my campaigns would say they published the photos, but then if I looked at the instagram accounts, nothing was actually published? I can&#039;t seem to figure out what I can do to fix this and it&#039;s really saddening because as far as I could tell, I was following steps correctly. I don&#039;t know where I went wrong in my settings causing it to not post the post but tell me that it did.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How can I tell Jarvee in which order to publish the photos that are inside a monitor folder? I know I could rename my images with numbers and use the &quot;1,2,...n[META_TITLE]&quot; token but I don&#039;t want to rename my images like that since I am using the &quot;[FILENAME]&quot; token and I don&#039;t want my post to include &quot;1,2,...n&quot;, in front of the caption. Thanks! :)]]></description>

You can use dropbox to share a folder on your computer and have access to it on your VPS. After that you go to Jarvee and use the monitor folder option to pick up images from that folder and use as posts. Once you add images to the folder on your computer they will also be addded to the VPS and Jarvee will automatically pick them up.]]></description>
