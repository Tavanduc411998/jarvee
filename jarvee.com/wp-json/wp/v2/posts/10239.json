As a result, it&#8217;s now a multi-billion dollar industry, and it features a host of impressive technology. Thanks to modern innovations, the gaming experience has become more sophisticated and fun than ever before.<\/p>\n<p>It may be that you need to buy a gift for a PC gamer but are struggling to know what to choose. If that&#8217;s the case, this article will answer all your questions and help you find the perfect present.<\/p>\n<h3>A Gaming Laptop Or Monitor<\/h3>\n<p>A gaming laptop is specifically created for gaming, as opposed to office or home use. They are usually more expensive than regular laptops because of the enhanced internal components. The graphics cards, processors, and RAM are designed specifically to run the latest games. On the internet, you can read about the <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.laptopblogger.com\/gaming-laptops-under-1500\/\">best gaming laptop under 1500<\/a><\/u>, which features a powerful processor like the Intel Core i7-10750H. It&#8217;s also possible to learn about 16+GB fast RAM, dedicated graphics cards, and super-fast load times. Potential buyers can compare the photos, read reviews and see the Amazon prices before they decide.<\/p>\n<p>A monitor is an essential component of any PC gaming experience because it acts as a window into the game. In today&#8217;s market, there are hundreds of different versions available &#8211; with some as cheap as $100 and others costing $1000 or more.<\/p>\n<h3>A Gaming Mouse Or Keyboard<\/h3>\n<p>A gaming mouse usually features programmable buttons and adjustable DPI, allowing you to change sensitivity on the fly. Interestingly, some mice can even track your heart rate! This level of customization makes gaming mice an awesome gift option, and there are many different models available.<\/p>\n<p>Gaming keyboards are another way to level up your gaming experience. Some keyboards light up, while others are designed for optimal performance. They do this by removing the Windows key or featuring macro keys that can be programmed to perform complex maneuvers with just one press. Some keyboards have built-in wrist rest for comfort and ergonomics, which can be important when your friend is gaming for literally hours on end.<\/p>\n<h3>Gaming Headphones And Stand<\/h3>\n<p>These headsets can be used on your computer, phone, or gaming system to provide an immersive experience during gameplay. While there are some older games that do not support surround sound, most new versions have this feature built-in. They come in wired and wireless versions, but the latter means it&#8217;s easier to move your arms without getting obstructed during the game.<\/p>\n<p>Headphone stands are great because they reduce clutter and keep everything looking organized. They can protect the phones from being a trip hazard or getting broken. If you have the budget, why not get a PC gaming headset with a built-in microphone? This way, your friend can communicate with their team members when playing online.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10241\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Extra-Storage.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Extra-Storage.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Extra-Storage-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Extra-Storage-600x400.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Extra Storage<\/h3>\n<p>An <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.infobloom.com\/what-is-a-multimedia-hard-drive.htm\">external hard drive<\/a><\/u> is an excellent gift for a PC gamer. It gives them the opportunity to bring their games anywhere, and it\u2019s an easy way to upgrade the storage space of their computer system. A lot of people choose an SSD because it allows you to not only store files on external devices, but also to download or install programs directly onto that device as well.<\/p>\n<p>You can also buy memory cards that can be used to store and save files (including downloadable content) on the console. They can be used for a variety of other features as well, such as downloading screenshots or movies.<\/p>\n<h3>A Subscription<\/h3>\n<p>If you know someone who loves gaming but is also interested in trying out new things, subscription services are a great option. Not only do they offer awesome deals on games and digital content, but they also give members access to the latest AAA titles before anyone else.<\/p>\n<p>If your friend or loved one likes playing the most popular online games, make sure that at least one of their subscriptions includes Xbox Live Gold. This service gives gamers unlimited access to using multiplayer modes with friends across any device. It also offers discounts on other subscription services like EA Access, which offers early release demos and additional game-based perks.<\/p>\n<p>You could provide a subscription to a gaming website like Twitch or YouTube Gaming so they can watch others play without having to buy any games themselves. Alternatively buy an online gift card for Steam, PSN, etc.<\/p>\n<h3>Game-Related Clothing<\/h3>\n<p>Clothing that features game characters or franchises would also make a great gift. This could be t-shirts with game logos, hats emblazoned with game brands, or other items that feature game images. The popularity of these types of clothes makes them easy to find and they are often available at low prices.<\/p>\n<p>You could alternatively buy shirts featuring PC components like RAM sticks, mousepads, or keyboards. Many gamers play for long hours and end up wearing socks that have become worn or full of holes. Having a supply of new pairs will always come in handy and you can purchase them with game logos on, or even have custom-made ones created using game images that you pick out yourself and upload online.<\/p>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10243\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/LED-Lighting.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/LED-Lighting.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/LED-Lighting-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/LED-Lighting-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>A Gaming Chair Or LED Lighting<\/h3>\n<p>Gaming chairs are a cozy way to game and they can provide essential back and neck support. They are adjustable for peoples&#8217; individual needs and some even come with built-in speakers or cup holders. They&#8217;re sold in many colors, helping ensure they will match the gaming equipment and room decor. You should know that <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.which.co.uk\/reviews\/light-bulbs\/article\/how-to-buy-the-best-light-bulb\/led-lights-explained-akCBG9o2F9U6\">LED lighting<\/a><\/u> strips can be attached to walls or the back of a desk, providing an excellent source of ambient light. They come in many different colors and lengths and some can be adjusted to match the specific mood of each game.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully, you have now seen something that&#8217;s within your budget and that your friend would definitely appreciate. As we said earlier, PC gamers spend large amounts of time immersed in their activities, so if you choose wisely they will get many hours of enjoyment from your gift. They&#8217;ll also appreciate the time and trouble you spent researching their favorite pastime.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Author<\/h3>\n<p>Jenna Kramer works as a Growth Assistant for a social platform where people ask questions, get expert video consultation, share knowledge and experience.
