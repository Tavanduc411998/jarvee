Parents who work remotely find it challenging to manage their infants and children who have started remote learnings programs.<\/p>\n<p>The pandemic has severely affected the woman employees. Many left their jobs to take care of their kids or reduced the working hours altogether. Some have opted for extended layoffs to avoid burnouts. These changes in situations have resulted in added stress for working families. The sudden shift causes many challenges for parent employees, which includes:<\/p>\n<h3>Juggling kid\u2019s online learning schedules and work<\/h3>\n<p>When both parents are working remotely, there won\u2019t be anyone to supervise &#8211; if your child is paying attention to the teacher during the online class sessions.
