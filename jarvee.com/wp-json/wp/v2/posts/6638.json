Quick to adopt the live streaming trend on other social media sites, LinkedIn introduced live video streaming feature on its professional site. The real-time videos brought a tremendous change in LinkedIn strategies. Interestingly, live broadcasters took over the trends on the social networking site and got 7% more reactions than a recorded video.<\/p>\n<p>Let us see the best uses of LinkedIn Live by some big shot companies:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Emirates NBD conducted a question\/answer session, allowing the prospects to ask anything<\/li>\n<li>Best Buy featured its CEO\u2019s interview in a live session<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/vimeo.com\/blog\/post\/linkedin-live-streaming-examples\/\">Hootsuite<\/a> used live streaming for attracting new candidates<\/li>\n<li>Digital Trends uses it to share daily news and increase user engagement<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The live streaming initiative proved to be a success story for businesses; it changed the way companies interacted with potential clients and employees.<\/p>\n<p>Let us learn how this live streaming can contribute to business growth:<\/p>\n<h2>1.\u00a0Direct Interaction With Prospective Clients<\/h2>\n<p>The main distinctive feature of live video is real-time interaction with clients. This is not possible in ordinary videos, where the client-company exchange has many limitations. For instance, a startup business introduced a conditional flash discount via recorded video. Customers got excited and asked a huge list of \u201cwhat if\u201d questions.<\/p>\n<p>Answering the questions repeatedly took a lot of time. Alternatively, when the brand switched to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.jarvee.com\/\">LinkedIn Live<\/a> for the same promotional campaign, they were able to conduct a productive real-time session with their clients. The brand answered user questions in real-time, which cleared many doubts.<\/p>\n<h2>2.\u00a0Promoting Your Company\u2019s Growth<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Promoting-Your-Company\u2019s-Growth.jpg\" alt=\"Promoting Your Company\u2019s Growth\" width=\"600\" height=\"388\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6640\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Promoting-Your-Company\u2019s-Growth.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Promoting-Your-Company\u2019s-Growth-300x194.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Gone are the days when a single post was enough to announce your new launch. Marketers are reaching out to innovative ways of declaring their new launches. A step- by \u2013step guesswork approach leading to a new product creates excitement and thrill.<\/p>\n<p>Since it is a live video, you can share reasons to launch the product, how the idea came into your mind, and how passionate is your brand regarding the new launch?<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Example: <\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A new firm used LinkedIn live videos to promote their new product. They came live and revealed that the product will be a helping hand for new moms. Moms and their little newborns can have a peaceful night with no nose blockage. Little ones can now breathe easily.<\/p>\n<p>However, it did not reveal what the product is, which created excitement and engagement with the brand. In the next live session, the brand declared that the new product is Nose Freeda that sucks up the mucus from the nose.<\/p>\n<h2>3.\u00a0Attracting Talented Employees<\/h2>\n<p>LinkedIn live gives a peek into the company\u2019s culture, work environment, and value.

Many professionals are big scale companies present on LinkedIn. It might also play a role in building third-party relations, B2B relationships, and hiring the best talents.<\/p>\n<p>Given the growth in teleworking due to COVID-19, many freelancing experts are holding live sessions on LinkedIn to help others reap the benefits of remote work.
