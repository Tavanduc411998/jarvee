					<description><![CDATA[Hi there, when scheduling images to be posted on Instagram stories I&#039;m getting a resolution issue. I&#039;m scraping posts from Facebook Photo album, setting images to be unique on medium setting. When the post goes up it is pixelated and blurry. Also how can I get post text to appear on the images I schedule for Instagram Stories?]]></description>

Hi Fernando,

go to Campaign&#039;s Overview tab &gt; Advanced settings &gt; Instagram and see do you have option &quot;Instagram - crop image instead of adding white borders&quot; checked. If it&#039;s checked, try unchecking it and posting again. If issue still persist, please send message to support.]]></description>

The users are tagged and they get notification, but we made it invisible on the post since it was ruining the pictures.
Regarding hashtags, they are also invisible, but added, so your story can be found under those hashtags.]]></description>

Nobody will be able to tell when you created the post and have you scheduled it through Jarvee or not. Nothing to worry about. It&#039;s just like you&#039;re posting them via phone app.]]></description>
