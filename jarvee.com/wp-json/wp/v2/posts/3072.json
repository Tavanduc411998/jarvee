A business ceases to exist without customer satisfaction. You, as the owner, should always strive hard to satisfy your customers\u00a0to guarantee a long-lasting relationship with them.<\/p>\n<p>Do you know that in most multinational companies and BPO centers, CSAT (or customer service satisfaction) is always a metric or key performance indicator for gauging employee performance? <\/p>\n<p>Surveys are randomly sent to customers so that the company can assess the capability of their employees in addressing customer\u2019s concern. Even small and home businesses are resorting to these surveys and questionnaires to assess if their business is answering their customer\u2019s needs and wants.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/customersupport.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"335\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1765\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/customersupport.jpeg 500w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/customersupport-300x201.jpeg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Social media has grown in leaps and bounds the past few years and with so many new networking sites being established all the time, they are here to stay. In fact, they have taken over traditional media and have become mainstream. Your business is not considered in if you do not have your own website, Facebook page, and other social media accounts even if it\u2019s just Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Google+, Instagram or Facebook. You must take advantage of the different social media networking sites to reach out to your customers and ensure their satisfaction with your brand.<\/p>\n<p>So how can you use social media to increase your customer happiness? Here\u2019s how:<\/p>\n<h3> #1 You can use social media to acknowledge customers<\/h3>\n<p>Are you selling gaming software or clothes online? You can always give a shout out to your customers by tweeting about their purchase or posting it as a status on Facebook. If you have pictures of your customer with your product, you can post it on Instagram or Pinterest.<\/p>\n<p>Aside from acknowledging their purchase, do not forget to thank them for supporting your business. In doing so, you are relaying to your customers that you are thankful that they chose your product over a competitor\u2019s. Acknowledging your customers will give them the feeling that they are important to your business.<\/p>\n<p>In CIO\u2019s article, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cio.com\/article\/2984024\/social-networking\/7-ways-social-media-can-improve-customer-satisfaction.html?page=2\">7 Ways Social Media Can Improve Customer Satisfaction<\/a>, it states that <b>highlighting your customer humanizes what you are trying to sell to the world<\/b>.<\/p>\n<h3>#2 You can use social media to ask your customers for opinions<\/h3>\n<p>It could be as mundane as holding a contest or giving a price for the 5000<sup>th<\/sup> follower but asking your customer for opinions regarding any aspect of your business means that you value their inputs and are taking their suggestions seriously.<\/p>\n<p>It also sets you apart from most companies who would not think twice about asking feedback from customers to run their business. Customer feedback is important to your business, especially when you are just starting.<\/p>\n<h3>#3 You can use social media to hold contests<\/h3>\n<p>Nothing makes a customer happier than partaking in various contests and raffle draws. You can use social media to inform customers of your various marketing strategies which include contests, raffle draws and the likes.<\/p>\n<p>You can use your different social media accounts as the venues for you to announce contest rules and mechanics. You could also announce winners through your Twitter or Facebook account.<\/p>\n<h3\">#4 You can use social media to promote new products and gimmicks<\/h3>\n<p>Having a new product to be launched in just a few weeks? Or is it time for your annual sale? Social media is the best, fastest and most effective way to inform so many people in so many different places at the shortest possible time. Plus promoting through social media costs little or nothing at all compared to the traditional method of advertising.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/team-work.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3095\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/team-work.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/team-work-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/team-work-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/team-work-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>#5 You can use social media to handle customer complaints<\/h3>\n<p>Irate customers are the worst kind of customers to have. Your instincts will tell you to ignore this type of customers but the best solution there is is to address their concerns. <\/p>\n<p>Why? <\/p>\n<p>Disgruntled and disappointed customers will not think twice about using social media to air out their grievances against your business. You have to keep a lid on it before it becomes viral. You don\u2019t want your customer\u2019s misunderstanding of your product\u2019s instruction to get shared, right?<\/p>\n<h3>#6 You can use social media for business modification through surveys<\/h3>\n<p>In Matt Janaway\u2019s article, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.socialmediatoday.com\/social-business\/matt-janaway\/2015-10-19\/can-social-media-increase-customer-happiness\">Can Social Media Increase Customer Happiness<\/a>?, Social polling is a win-win situation for you, the business owner, and your customers. This is one way for you to gauge what your customer really wants from your business and you may change some product or service features to adjust to your customer\u2019s opinions.<\/p>\n<p>In doing product modification or addition, you must have the pulse on what your customers need and want to ensure that you are able to supply them with it. <b>By asking specific questions, you eliminate unnecessary features and benefits that your customers might not find useful for them<\/b>.<\/p>\n<h3>#7 You can use social media to monitor brands and mentions<\/h3>\n<p>Monitoring brands and mention is one way of tracking the success (or unfortunately, the lack of it) of your business. The more mentions your business receive, the more people have become aware of the existence of the products and services that you are trying to sell.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/customer-feedback.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3094\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/customer-feedback.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/customer-feedback-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/customer-feedback-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/customer-feedback-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>#8 You can use social media for customer retention<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.clientheartbeat.com\/why-customer-satisfaction-is-important\/\">Fact of life<\/a>&#8211; you lose money when you lose customers. <b>You spend up to 7 times more to get new customers than retaining your old ones<\/b>. For a small business, spending much more than what you\u2019re supposed to do is business and economic suicide.<\/p>\n<p>So how can social media help you retain your customers? Social media is your fastest way to communicate with your customers. It is even faster than exchanging emails. Being able to answer your customers immediately shows how valuable they are to your business.<\/p>\n<p>Developing a business relationship with your customer will also ensure retention. Aside from getting satisfaction from your goods and services, customers remain loyal to a brand if they feel that they are being valued as customers. An example that you can give value to your customers is by giving them shout outs or tweets on their birthdays or mentioning them in passing. You don\u2019t have to do anything elaborate. You just need to acknowledge how valuable they are to your business.<\/p>\n<h3>Wrapping It Up<\/h3>\n<p><b><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.clientheartbeat.com\/12-customer-retention-mistakes-that-are-hurting-your-business\/\">Customer happiness<\/a> or satisfaction is one major indicator if your business will survive or not.<\/b> One way to really ensure that your customers are happy with you is to deliver what you have promised them. Don\u2019t go the route of false advertising, it will come back to haunt you at great consequences. Treat your customers well. They are the lifeline of your business. Do not take them for granted or ignore their feedback. Address their concerns and make your customers happy.<\/p>\n<p>Social Media has many uses for your business and personal life. Not only does it act as an avenue for you to promote your business, the various social media platforms help you have a more personalized interaction with your customers.
