You need to drive high-quality traffic to your website and increase their retention on the landing page. To measure their retention on the landing page, we use bounce rate. <\/p>\n<h2><b>What is bounce rate?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p> The Bounce rate is the percentage of the <strong>ratio of people\u00a0who leave the landing page to the people who stay on the landing page<\/strong>, all in a specified amount of time.  \u00a0So for example, if the majority of your traffic views a webpage of yours and then immediately exits, that indicates a high bounce rate.   <\/p>\n<p><b>A low bounce rate<\/b> is considered a good bounce rate. Why? Becuase it means that there is a lower percentage of people &#8216;bouncing&#8217; of your page. Hence, a bounce rate below 40% is a good bounce rate. As the number suggests, it could mean either that people are enjoying the content hence staying for a longer duration or that more people are exploring different areas of the website.\u00a0  <\/p>\n<p><b>A high bounce rate<\/b> is then, of course, something very bad. It should be avoided at all costs and the landing page should be optimized as soon as possible.\u00a0 A high bounce rate would usually indicate misleading content, dull content, content without any media etc. A bounce rate above 60%,  especially for content sites, is a bad bounce rate and measures should be taken to change it.  <\/p>\n<p>These percentages  <b>may be different<\/b>  for your site and niche.   <\/p>\n<p>In reality, there may exist different reasons that make your web pages&#8217; bounce rate increase.   <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3401\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/inner-sherlock-min.jpg\" alt=\"good bounce rate sherlock\" width=\"401\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/inner-sherlock-min.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/inner-sherlock-min-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/inner-sherlock-min-768x575.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/inner-sherlock-min-600x449.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px\" \/> <\/p>\n<p>To spot the culprit, you&#8217;ll need to unleash your inner Sherlock Holmes. Then open your <b>analytics<\/b> platform of choice, be it  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/\"> HubSpot <\/a>  or Google Analytics, and figure out exactly why people are bouncing too much. <\/p>\n<p>Below are some measures you can take to improve your websites or landing pages bounce rate. <\/p>\n<h2><b>Enhance Your Page Load Time<\/b> . <\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3400\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/google-page-speed-test-min.jpg\" alt=\"page load speed for good bounce rate\" width=\"582\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/google-page-speed-test-min.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/google-page-speed-test-min-300x206.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/google-page-speed-test-min-768x526.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/google-page-speed-test-min-600x411.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px\" \/> <\/p>\n<p>Take a Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/speed\/pagespeed\/insights\/\">Page Speed test<\/a>. See if there exist problems with the load time.<\/p>\n<p>Are you thinking &#8221; so what if I have a slow page-load speed? &#8221;<br \/>\nWell, these days Google really prioritizes sites with a good user experience. Of course, if you have a low page load speed, you will have a higher bounce rate. And in terms of mobile, your website NEEDS to have an optimized speed otherwise you will not only get a higher bounce rate, but also a big dip in the SERPS of Google. <\/p>\n<p>With that in mind, the design and layout of your website should have a rather simplistic\u00a0user interface. Information should be easy to find without spending hours in searching on the website.<\/p>\n<p> SearchEngineJournal.com has a  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/wordpress-plugins-page-speed\/220533\/\"> guide <\/a> on some WordPress plugins that decrease page load time.  <\/p>\n<p>Do you have pop-up ads and auto-play music\/videos on your website?<\/p>\n<p>If yes, then\u00a0 <b>get rid of them ASAP<\/b> .   <\/p>\n<p>Aside from lowering your page speed, this type of media only makes your traffic regret their decision of coming to your website forcing them to hit the back button of their browser. <\/p>\n<h2><b>Analyze Your Bounce Rate Per Medium<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3408\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/social-media-min.jpg\" alt=\"social media sites for good bounce rate\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/social-media-min.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/social-media-min-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/social-media-min-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/social-media-min-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/social-media-min-600x600.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you have traffic coming from your email list, analyze the open rate and the bounce rate. If your traffic is from a referral site or paid traffic, analyze the click-through-rate and bounce rate.\u00a0  If it&#8217;s from another channel, analyze the important metrics including the bounce rate. <\/p>\n<p>If the bounce rate from social networks is relatively high, see whether the traffic&#8217;s initial intent for reading the article matches the intent of the article itself. If traffic from organic search has a high bounce rate, see whether you&#8217;re not using misleading descriptions or titles.  <\/p>\n<p>Then, have a quick look at the bounce rate of your blog posts and the content that drove the lowest bounce rate for a rough idea of your audience persona.  <\/p>\n<p>A contact page or TOC page with an 80% bounce rate is very expected. But if a landing page\u2019s\/product page&#8217;s bounce rate lies along the same lines, you need to start with A\/B split testing and prepare for optimization.\u00a0 <\/p>\n<h2><b>Show your product or content first<\/b><\/h2>\n<p> <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3404\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/show-product-first-min.jpg\" alt=\"good bounce rate e-commerce website\" width=\"600\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/show-product-first-min.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/show-product-first-min-300x213.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/show-product-first-min-768x545.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/show-product-first-min-600x426.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/> <\/p>\n<p>If people are coming to your site for an eCommerce product, make sure you <b>showcase your products first<\/b>. If they&#8217;re coming to your site because you&#8217;re service oriented, or an informational site, make sure you <b>showcase the description first<\/b>.  <\/p>\n<p>Some blogs showcase their email opt-ins or Call-To-Actions, forcing you to scroll down beneath the fold before you go to the content. This causes the bounce rate to increase.  <\/p>\n<p>Showcasing the product or the important content first will serve the user intent and reduce the bounce rate.  <\/p>\n<h2><b>Use Multimedia<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3411\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Mutimedia-min-1.jpg\" alt=\"multi media for good bounce rate\" width=\"600\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Mutimedia-min-1.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Mutimedia-min-1-300x266.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Mutimedia-min-1-768x682.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/Mutimedia-min-1-600x533.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Make sure you add in interesting multimedia. The multimedia could be an image, \u00a0a video, a gif or it could even be an audio file.   In essence, it&#8217;s just another type of content that&#8217;s not text based and keeps your traffic engaged.  <\/p>\n<p> High-quality multimedia keeps the individuals&#8217; eyes locked for some time, therefore, decreasing the bounce rate. <\/p>\n<h2><b>Optimal User Experience And Design<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>User experience is one of the most important aspects of your product\/service and the same applies to your website. <\/p>\n<p>You can take the <b> following steps<\/b>  to enhance the user experience on your website. <\/p>\n<h3><b>1.
