					<description><![CDATA[The last time, me and my partner did a Facebook Live Videos for our new product launch which was a course about how to make money reskinning apps instead of - webinar which we normally do - and we got a higher number of viewers which meant more sales for our course.

I will surely try it again with one of my next product launches and see if I will get the same result.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just noticed that if you are a member of a group, you can go live inside it and take advantage of that group audience, with the right software to stream pre recorded videos as live videos I can promote my affiliate offers for free to group members. Be right back :joy:]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Live videos can be powerful for your brand but make sure you are prepared for your audience questions and keep a positive attitude when answering their questions.

Also make sure you test the audio quality of you recording device before you start the live video.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for sharing these useful insights.

The fact you shared &quot;on average people watch live videos more than three times longer&quot; really shocked me but it does make sense, to be honest I never used Facebook Live Videos as one of my Social Media marketing strategies but I&#039;m considering it now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Adam,

Thanks for this, it&#039;s appreciated!

From my point of view, the first point that you noted - &quot;#1 Facebook Live Video can allow your followers a more personal and engaging online experience&quot; is a foundation of the live video and video in general. It&#039;s purpose is to create stronger relationship with your followers. I believe that videos will be used even more in this year and looking forward to discover more ways to upscale my business with videos.]]></description>
