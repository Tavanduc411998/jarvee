I have detailed different things you can try and might help you continue to post on Facebook groups with no problems. Many people complained that some of those methods were a bit hard to implement though so I kept testing things out in the hopes of finding a good and easier way to continue posting and it\u2019s good that I did because I think I found one that still works.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2341 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/facebook-groups-marketing-with-Jarvee-300x132.jpg\" alt=\"facebook groups marketing with Jarvee\" width=\"300\" height=\"132\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/facebook-groups-marketing-with-Jarvee-300x132.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/facebook-groups-marketing-with-Jarvee-600x263.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/facebook-groups-marketing-with-Jarvee.jpg 643w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What I\u2019ve discovered is that Facebook doesn\u2019t really care about the total numbers of groups you post in, it mostly looks at your actions. So if all you do on Facebook is post on groups, it will see that fast and take action. What you need to do is hide the group posting among other actions you do on Facebook, those are: wall posts, likes, comments and likes on pages, send messages and friend invites and so on. So what you need to do is set your accounts to not only post in groups but do all these other actions and do a lot of them, the one you can do the most is post on your wall so you can start from there.<\/p>\n<p>Let me show you how you can easily do this:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The first and most important thing is to create a secondary campaign ( let\u2019s name it \u201cWall poster\u201d) that you will be using to publish on your wall. Create a destination list with just that account as a destination. Select this destination list as a destination to post to in the where to publish tab of the \u201cWall poster\u201d campaign.<\/li>\n<li>In the When to publish tab of the \u201cWall poster\u201d select maximum number of posts per day 60-80 or something high enough that will ensure this campaign posts often to your wall to hide the group posting. For the publishing delay you can use 300-400 seconds.<\/li>\n<li>Go to the What to publish tab -&gt; add posts from RSS and add at least 4-7 different RSS feeds that are updated often. The idea here is to have a lot of fresh and good content. The RSS feeds can be anything you want, from news sites, joke sites. You can create an RSS feed from any Pinterest board by adding \u201c.rss\u201d at the end of the URL ( for example for a board from our account you can create an RSS feed like this: <a href=\"https:\/\/pinterest.com\/jarveesocial\/jarvee.rss\/\">https:\/\/pinterest.com\/jarveesocial\/jarvee.rss\/<\/a> ). You can create an RSS feed for almost any Tumblr site by adding \u201c\/rss\u201d at the end of the URL and so on. RSS is almost everywhere on the web so I am sure you can find a few great source. Here is how it should look like in the RSS table:<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2335\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/adding-rss-feeds-to-your-facebook-posts-with-jarvee.jpg\" alt=\"adding rss feeds to your facebook posts with jarvee\" width=\"1147\" height=\"670\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/adding-rss-feeds-to-your-facebook-posts-with-jarvee.jpg 1147w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/adding-rss-feeds-to-your-facebook-posts-with-jarvee-300x175.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/adding-rss-feeds-to-your-facebook-posts-with-jarvee-768x449.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/adding-rss-feeds-to-your-facebook-posts-with-jarvee-1024x598.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/adding-rss-feeds-to-your-facebook-posts-with-jarvee-600x350.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1147px) 100vw, 1147px\" \/><br \/>\nYou can play around with the feeds, add links back to the original article, post only images and so on. I would advise that at least for some of the posts you add backlinks to the original article, this way Facebook will see you posting other links as well, not only your link to the groups.<\/li>\n<li>Now that you have your Wall poster campaign created with unlimited content just start it and it will begin to post on your wall. This will hide your post on Facebook groups really well.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This alone will help you a lot by creating a more random pattern of you using your Facebook account, now let\u2019s see what else you can randomize:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\u00a0Set the account actions tool for that account to automatically like stuff on your wall that your friends and sites you follow post. You can also enable auto accept friend requests if you have enough spots left as well as automatically send a message to the people you accept as friends. Most of these actions are not shown anywhere though, so it doesn\u2019t hurt you in any way to be generous. Remember not to set it too aggressive as Facebook can ban you from liking stuff as well if you over-do it.<\/li>\n<li>Set up the \u201cContact\u201d tool, that can help you send messages to other people or send friend invites. You might want to use only the send friend invites, just go to a group that is in your niche, extract all the members from there and slowly send them friend invites. Make sure to check the \u201ccancel friend request if they do not accept\u201d option and set it to 5 days. Also, don\u2019t over-do it, 5-20 friend requests per day should do it and make your account look good. In time, you\u2019ll have plenty of friends that will follow what you post.<\/li>\n<li>Lastly there\u2019s the Comment&amp;Like tool. With this tool you can comment and like on posts from pages and groups. As we want to make this as varied as possible, I would advise you to only comment and like on pages, not groups.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I want to re-iterate something that I also said in the previous article. <b>Spinning your post is a must if you want to post on Facebook groups<\/b>, it needs to be as different as possible. Spinning is quite easy if you use the provided tool in Jarvee, and it usually takes only a couple of minutes. Here\u2019s how one of my articles that I posted with this account looks like:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2338\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/spinned-post-to-share-to-facebook-groups-2.jpg\" alt=\"spinned post to share to facebook groups 2\" width=\"600\" height=\"232\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/spinned-post-to-share-to-facebook-groups-2.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/spinned-post-to-share-to-facebook-groups-2-300x116.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you can see all the text is spun and I also add a couple of extra random symbols before the text and around the link. The link is not spinned, just shortened with goo.gl as the main idea of this share is to get more social signals. If you\u2019re not looking for those and just want people to go to your landing page you can spin the URL as well, thus leaving even fewer traces<\/p>\n<p>In case you\u2019re wondering about the settings of the campaign that is actually doing the group posting here you go :<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2339\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/setting-up-your-facebook-group-posting-campaign-in-Jarvee.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"980\" height=\"572\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/setting-up-your-facebook-group-posting-campaign-in-Jarvee.jpg 980w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/setting-up-your-facebook-group-posting-campaign-in-Jarvee-300x175.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/setting-up-your-facebook-group-posting-campaign-in-Jarvee-768x448.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/setting-up-your-facebook-group-posting-campaign-in-Jarvee-600x350.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You will notice that the delay between posts is quite high, 720 seconds to allow time for the wall posting and other tools to do their part as well. This is what worked for me with an old account; you can experiment with the settings and see what works for you. Your account might be new, and you will need to higher the settings even more or you might decide to try and be more aggressive.<\/p>\n<p>This is pretty much it. Again, the idea is to make your account do as many varied actions as possible. For my experiment with this account I only posted to the wall a lot and used the Account Actions tool. I did not set the others to run and it still worked nicely. At the moment I am doing tests with these other tools running as well to see how much I can get away with. I will update this article as soon as I have more results.<\/p>\n<p>What you should\u00a0 take from this is the following: To post on Facebook groups is still very much possible and many people keep doing it because it&#8217;s one of the main techniques to drive a lot of traffic from said platform to your site. Don&#8217;t give up, just do it smarter.<\/p>\n<p>Let me know how this works for you so we can all improve!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is somewhat of a hot subject lately, many of you probably read my previous article on How To Successfully Post To Multiple Facebook And Not Get Your Accounts Limited.
