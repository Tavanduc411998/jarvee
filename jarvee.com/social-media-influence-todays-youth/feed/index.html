					<description><![CDATA[Social media &quot;de-socialize&quot; youth. Why? Because today&#039;s youth live in cyberspace, not in the real one. Staring into the screen is much more important than going to the parks and in the woods, it&#039;s easier.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article, thanks for sharing! I just wanted to say that the social media influence, good or bad, in most cases depends from parents attitude and their knowledge about social media. I recommend that the parents learn about social media and to use them just to know what their children can possibly do there, parents must know how to control them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I believe that this is on a big level related to how kids are being raised and what examples are their parents giving them. Yes, youth have to keep up with trends and try and learn about new things, but there is a big role that parents should take in this and teach their kids to only take good from social medial and to pay attention to how much time their kids spend online and what they do online.]]></description>
