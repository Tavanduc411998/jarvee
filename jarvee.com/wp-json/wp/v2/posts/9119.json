There&#8217;s also no doubt that you post those photos on at least one of your social media accounts. Have you ever considered monetizing those photos? Mind you, some cat or <a href=\"https:\/\/pawsomeadvice.com\/dog\/calm-dog-breeds\">dog breeds<\/a> will do better than others, but there are still ways to get your pet famous and earn money regardless of their type. Instagram can be your gold mine.<\/p>\n<h2>Make Your Pet Famous<\/h2>\n<p>Managing Instagram can be easy if you&#8217;re devoted and have enough time to learn its algorithms. This is how to set up your account for success.<\/p>\n<h3>Consider Your Pet&#8217;s Persona<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9121 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/cat-984097_640.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/cat-984097_640.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/cat-984097_640-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/cat-984097_640-600x338.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To become Instagram famous, you&#8217;ll want to become a pet influencer. Before you start your journey, consider what characteristics your pet has and how to accentuate them. Create a personality around your pet, and keep it consistent. Think about what your pet would say if it were a human.<\/p>\n<p>Create a voice behind the image and make it recognizable. Create a unique hashtag for your pet, too. This will help your account stand out. Followers love a unique personality both in people and animals. If your pet delivers, they&#8217;ll be happy to click the Follow button.<\/p>\n<h3>Invest in the Equipment<\/h3>\n<p>Instagram is all about photos, so you&#8217;ll want to make the best ones you can. Today&#8217;s phones are enough to make a decent image, but if you&#8217;re aiming for massive success, you&#8217;ll want to invest in proper photography equipment. This includes the hardware:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>lights<\/li>\n<li>cameras<\/li>\n<li>memory cards<\/li>\n<li>tripods, and similar<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Since every image posted online is retouched, investing in software like Photoshop or a <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-to-use-canva-to-create-high-quality-instagram-posts\/\">similar program<\/a> is also a good idea.<\/p>\n<h3>Practice Your Photography Skills<\/h3>\n<p>Since you figured out your pet&#8217;s persona and you have your equipment, it&#8217;s time to practice photo sessions with your pet. While it seems easy, photography can be complicated.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t post the first photos you take. You&#8217;ll want to go around and ask your family and friends what they think about your skills. It also wouldn&#8217;t hurt to take a short photography course. It will make the whole process easier for you.<\/p>\n<h3>Grow Your Followers<\/h3>\n<div id=\"attachment_9123\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9123\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-9123\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/jiffpom.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"434\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/jiffpom.png 1403w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/jiffpom-300x203.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/jiffpom-1024x694.png 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/jiffpom-768x521.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/jiffpom-600x407.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-9123\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">image credit to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jiffpom\/\">IG account<\/a><\/p><\/div>\n<p>Building a loyal fanbase is a path to success on Instagram. You&#8217;ll be able to land solid sponsorships with as little as 10,000 followers. But of course, you&#8217;ll want the number to grow organically. To do this, stay active. Post every day at least two times in different time zones. Use hashtag finder websites to see the most popular hashtags and combine them with some less popular ones.<\/p>\n<p>Besides posting and hashtagging, commenting on other pet accounts. Show support, interact, and this will result in others visiting your page. By doing this, you&#8217;re staying in your niche and attracting your target audience. Never buy your followers. This can result in low activity and, in some cases, an account ban.<\/p>\n<h3>Utilize Other Apps<\/h3>\n<p>If you find posting on Instagram overwhelming, you can always opt for scheduling apps. There are many free and paid apps out there that work wonders for Instagram scheduling. With those apps, you&#8217;ll also be able to create an eye-catching Instagram aesthetic.<\/p>\n<p>Besides scheduling apps, you might want to consider apps that let you include unique fonts, frames, collages, grids, filters, or even multiple links in your bio section. This will also make your feed pop and <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/instagram-marketing-get-first-1000-followers\/\">attract followers<\/a>. With the addition of creative photography and catchy captions, your success is guaranteed.<\/p>\n<h3>Give and Get Shoutouts<\/h3>\n<p>Instagram is all about collaboration and support. The pet niche is super friendly, and that&#8217;s why shoutouts are a great idea. Start by <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.oberlo.com\/blog\/instagram-shoutout\">giving a shoutout<\/a><\/u> to another account. Show why your online friendship is meaningful to you.<\/p>\n<p>When others see you give support, they&#8217;ll be happy to include you in their shoutouts. Eventually, you should aim at getting a shoutout from a larger account in your niche that will bring their followers to you. Remember, there will be many messages in your inbox asking for a shoutout. You probably won&#8217;t reply to all. It&#8217;s your pet&#8217;s account, and it should stay focused on you and your friend.<\/p>\n<h2>Start Making Money<\/h2>\n<p>This can be a tricky step since many people don&#8217;t know how to start getting sponsorship offers. There are many ways you can land sponsorships based on your pet&#8217;s Instagram account, starting with pitching to brands.<\/p>\n<h3>Make a Pitch<\/h3>\n<p>Consider which brands you want to promote. <u><a href=\"https:\/\/later.com\/blog\/pitch-to-brands\/\">Write a pitch email<\/a><\/u> that you&#8217;ll send directly to your potential sponsors. Introduce yourself, your pet, and Instagram stats. Say that your pet loves the products and that you&#8217;ll love to promote them. If you&#8217;ve had any relevant brand partnerships before, make sure to mention them as well.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that brands will react differently. Some may not respond at all, and some might be thrilled with your account. Make sure the brand aligns with what you support on your account. For example, promoting cat food on your dog&#8217;s page makes no sense. Staying in your niche will increase the chances for collaboration.<\/p>\n<h3>Money Should Be Your Goal<\/h3>\n<p>Some brands will offer a product in exchange for the promotion. While getting that nice bag of treats is a lovely way to make your pet happy, remember that you&#8217;re here to make money. If you&#8217;re okay with accepting these offers in the beginning, that&#8217;s fine. In the future, don&#8217;t be afraid to name your price.<\/p>\n<p>Many brands won&#8217;t have a problem sending you a product and still paying a smaller fee for you to promote them. Your price should be based on the current market. Also, create a simple media kit that brands can easily find in your bio.<\/p>\n<h3>Go Local If Possible<\/h3>\n<p>Try to reach out to local brands. Visit their store, purchase their products, and mention that you want to promote them. Don&#8217;t ask for free stuff like some influencers. The store owner is more likely to work with you if you show some respect.<\/p>\n<p>As your Instagram following grows, you might get invited to some local events with your pet. Those events can be various competitions, fairs, or even fundraising events. This is an excellent opportunity to network more and showcase your services in other cities. Still, make sure your pet is okay with traveling and being around people.<\/p>\n<h3>Become an Affiliate<\/h3>\n<p>Affiliate marketing is one of the most lucrative methods to earn money online. You&#8217;ll have to register with some of the affiliate networks, such as ShareASale, and join the merchant network of affiliates. You&#8217;ll get a personalized link you can post online. Once someone purchases the item via your link, you&#8217;ll receive a commission.<\/p>\n<p>Select merchants that have high stats in terms of sales, commission rates, and audience. Affiliates usually promote products that they tried, but that&#8217;s not always the case. Remember to follow the FTC rules and <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.privacypolicies.com\/blog\/ftc-affiliate-disclosure\/\">adequately disclose your affiliate and sponsored posts<\/a><\/u>.<\/p>\n<h3>Sell Your Merch<\/h3>\n<p>With enough followers on Instagram, you can earn a substantial amount of money by pointing them to the website where you <u><a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/blog\/how-to-sell-your-products-on-instagram\">sell your merch<\/a><\/u>. You can sell physical products, like socks, shirts, stickers, or hoodies with the print of your pet. There are also digital goods you can offer, like photos.<\/p>\n<p>If you decide to stock up and create the products yourself, you&#8217;ll need some capital to start and a place to stock the inventory. You&#8217;ll also need essential equipment. Selling the merchandise with your pet on it also requires some digital marketing skills. You&#8217;ll want to do a product launch, giveaway, or promotions to reach your buyers and build a stronger relationship with your followers.<\/p>\n<h2>Final Notes<\/h2>\n<p>Even though putting maximum effort into your Instagram account can be daunting, creating an account for your pet can lead to great monetization options. Start by building your presence on Instagram with exciting photos and catchy captions. Support others, and they will return the love.<\/p>\n<p>After some time, you can consider monetizing your content. Reach out to brands and offer a promotion or create merchandise with your pet on it. Keep on networking, and don&#8217;t forget to have fun with your pet first and foremost.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Author<\/h3>\n<p>Milica Strugar is a prolific article writer, an industrious researcher, tech enthusiast, and passionate about utilising every piece of modern technology at her disposal to find the answers she seeks.
