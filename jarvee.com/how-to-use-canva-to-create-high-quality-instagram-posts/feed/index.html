					<description><![CDATA[I’m a little confused on how to take the post I’ve created and post it to Instagram. Where you have mentioned create a destination list and add it to the campaign. Where do I do that and how do I post to these accounts?]]></description>

Of course there is. What you need to do is create destination list that contains your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest account and add it to campaign. In When to publish tab of your campaign make sure you check the option &quot;Publish a post list item on all selected destinations&quot;. This way each of your posts in Posts lists will be published on all social profiles that you have added to destination list.]]></description>
