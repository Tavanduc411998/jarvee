					<description><![CDATA[Contest and giveaways are awesome, everyone loves them and your customers will be happy about it. Results should always be transparent so that customers don’t feel  like it was a scam. In my company, we pay attention to our customers happiness and we often discuss how we can improve it. Thanks for sharing!]]></description>
