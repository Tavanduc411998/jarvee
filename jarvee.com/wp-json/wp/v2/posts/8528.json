Creating short, highly entertaining videos that people can easily share across different platforms has made lots of users viral sensations overnight.<\/p>\n<p>This reason is why you want to use TikTok as part of your social media strategy. The immense potential of getting a single video spread like wildfire online can help <a href=\"https:\/\/www.latana.com\/post\/tik-tok-brand-building\">build your brand quicker<\/a> than any platform out there.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, you will learn how to create videos that people will want to see so you can get your brand out there front and center.<\/p>\n<h2>Refine your content creation process<\/h2>\n<p>This is the most crucial part of creating viral videos on TikTok or any platform in general. Your videos will only resonate with people if you can create something that they\u2019d want to watch in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>To begin, you need to check out the most popular and shared videos in your niche. See what makes people share them online and what they\u2019re saying about it. The goal here is to create videos that are similar to &#8211; if not <em>better<\/em> than &#8211; the viral videos in your space.<\/p>\n<p>Next, you begin creating the video. If you\u2019re new to this, expect to experience bumps along the way. Your <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-to-edit-a-tiktok-video-in-2020\/\">shots aren\u2019t as good as you want them to be or you used the wrong filter for your videos<\/a>. These are just some of the things you need to undergo towards becoming a good content creator.<\/p>\n<p>You may need to enlist the help of tools to make your job easier. For example, PlayPlay, a <a href=\"https:\/\/playplay.com\/\">video creation tool<\/a> that allows you to make professional videos without any editing experience.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, you need to consider between quantity over quality &#8211; should you churn out <em>more<\/em> videos with lower quality or <em>fewer <\/em>videos but with better quality?<\/p>\n<p>Ideally, you need to analyze which type of videos you create attracts the most engagement from users. Then see if you can replicate the process in a sustainable way so you can create and publish more videos without compromising quality.<\/p>\n<p>By striking the balance between both, you can scale your content creation process and publish at will.<\/p>\n<h2>Ride the wave of trends<\/h2>\n<p>Using trends as themes for your TikTok videos can help you attract more views quickly and more efficiently.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, leveraging on trends to boost your views on TikTok is all about <em>speed<\/em>. The faster you can create the best video about a trend, the more people will see and share it over time.<\/p>\n<p>Creating unique and high-quality content takes creativity as well as a refined content creation process which we discussed earlier.<\/p>\n<p>To do this, you need to be up to date with the latest trending hashtags on TikTok.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8531\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tiktok-trends.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"296\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tiktok-trends.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tiktok-trends-300x142.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tiktok-trends-600x285.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>From here, you\u2019ll find the type of content associated with those tags and create a similar and\/or better video than the ones published.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use external sources like Google Trends to stay in the pulse of the latest and current trends.<\/p>\n<h2>Collaborate with influencers<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to fast-track your way to TikTok fame, you must partner with influencers in your space and collaborate on as many videos as you wish.<\/p>\n<p>The fact that these influencers have an established audience means you get to tap into those people and have them as followers of your account if they like what you create.<\/p>\n<p>However, to get to this stage, you need to get in the good graces of influencers first, <a href=\"https:\/\/viralmango.com\/how-to-find-tiktok-influencers\/\">which is another process altogether<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This involves finding the right people to reach out to and sending over your pitch. And even if you do things right, there\u2019s a chance they won\u2019t reply to your message and ignore you altogether. In this case, you need to help them become more familiar with who you are, and you can only do this if you <em>react to their videos<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>To give you ideas, check the #reacttothis tag to see how people react to other TikTok videos.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8529\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tiktok-influencers.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"521\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tiktok-influencers.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tiktok-influencers-300x250.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Tiktok-influencers-600x501.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Cross-promote TikTok content on other social media platforms<\/h2>\n<p>Exclusively focusing on TikTok to get more eyeballs to your content is not a bad play at all. However, publishing the same content on other platforms is the <em>smarter<\/em> play between the two.<\/p>\n<p>The chances of going viral by sharing your content on sites like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook go up as opposed to just sharing it on TikTok.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, you want to leverage Instagram\u2019s 1B+ audience and get a portion of that audience to check out your TikTok videos.<\/p>\n<p>The easiest way to do that is by linking both platforms together. From here, you can cross-publish your content from either platform to strengthen your brand.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a TikTok alternative, Instagram also offers the closest one with <em>Reels<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>In a nutshell, Instagram Reels are much shorter (15-second videos compared minute-long TikTok videos), but it has <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.genbook.com\/how-to-use-reels-instagram\/\">audio focus and better editing capabilities<\/a>. More importantly, Reels behave like a feed post, which means you can add up to 30 hashtags and allow comments to hike up views and engagement.<\/p>\n<p>You may want to consider repurposing your TikTok content and upload it to fit the format of Instagram Reels.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, you want to develop a strategy where you can share your TikTok videos on other platforms.<\/p>\n<p>This is where JARVEE comes into play. You can set up your Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Tumblr accounts to automatically share your videos and drive more views to them. This way, you can focus on creating more viral videos as you put your social media plan on autopilot.<\/p>\n<h2>Engage with your audience<\/h2>\n<p>How you interact with your audience could play a role in building a dedicated audience and getting more views to your videos.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re sharing your TikTok content across different platforms, you can be getting DMs from each site.<\/p>\n<p>Normally, you login from one account to another to check the messages and reply to each one. However, this is a cumbersome process that could take hours to complete especially if you receive lots of messages from your viral video.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, consider getting a platform where you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.liveagent.com\/help-desk-software\/\">consolidate all your messages in a single place<\/a>. This way, you can focus on the quality of the response instead of worrying about not getting back to them on time.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking of response, you need to stay as upbeat and positive as possible when interacting with others. It\u2019s easy to fall prey to trolls and naysayers who have nothing good to say about anything.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s best to focus your attention on people who appreciate what you\u2019re doing and provide feedback on how you can improve your TikTok videos.<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s next?<\/h2>\n<p>Due to the popularity of TikTok, lots of people have tried their hand at getting viral success from the platform. While there are those who carved out successes, most have fizzled and given up on their dream of becoming a viral hit.<\/p>\n<p>However, as with most social platforms, it\u2019s all about putting in the work and staying consistent even if you\u2019re not generating the views you expected.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, you need to keep chugging along and keep producing videos for your brand. Because it\u2019s not about being an overnight success. Rather, it\u2019s about <em>developing trust with your audience through this platform<\/em> while having fun along the way.<\/p>\n<p>But once you\u2019ve struck rich and built a massive following from your TikTok videos, you open your brand to lots of opportunities!<\/p>\n<p>You can monetize your newfound success by promoting products in line with your brand. Companies may approach you to feature their goods on a custom video you\u2019ll create for them.<\/p>\n<p>You can also join <a href=\"https:\/\/peertopeermarketing.co\/influencer-management\/\">influencer marketing platforms<\/a> where you can promote your social media accounts and field offers from businesses looking to get more eyeballs to their products and services.<\/p>\n<p>But for now, keep creating TikTok videos and promoting them like crazy using JARVEE.
