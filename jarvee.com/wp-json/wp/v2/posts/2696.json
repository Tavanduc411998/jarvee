Swelling Figures<\/h4>\n<p>To start with, there are <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/01\/instagram-whatsapp-vs-snapchat\/\">over 300 million Instagram users<\/a> that use this feature on a daily basis.\u00a0 With that incredible number of people, and still growing, already on the venue, you can expect a phenomenal party.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2723 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"354\" height=\"279\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories.png 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-300x236.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-600x473.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>2.\u00a0Anytime Is A Good Time<\/h4>\n<p>Unlike when you publish a post, you need to make sure that you have a strategy in place so that it can reach as much audience as possible.\u00a0 You need to note down when your followers are most active and fire away on those times. But with Stories, you can ease yourself of such task since what you&#8217;ve posted there is visible within 24 hours, so you can just opt to publish on certain intervals, like 6-8 hours or in between 12 hours at most.<\/p>\n<h4>3.\u00a0It Is Not Limiting<\/h4>\n<p>Although your Stories has a 24-hour shelf life, this does not mean that you have limited reach.\u00a0 Anyone can view your Stories regardless if they are followers or non-followers.\u00a0 You have a day to leave an impression, hence, make it worth their while.<\/p>\n<h4>4.\u00a0Hashtags Hashtags<\/h4>\n<h4><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2725 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"275\" height=\"183\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-2.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-2-600x399.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px\" \/><\/h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been doing Instagram and other social networks for some time now, then you already know what this &#8220;#&#8221; character\u00a0can do for your post.\u00a0 But if you are still clueless on that, then you must first understand the <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/use-hashtags-facebook-twitter-g-pinterest-instagram\/\">reason why you need to use hashtags.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>That said, you can add a hashtag to your Stories and with the right ones, you might even land on top of the feed when people do a search, hence Instagram makes you discoverable.<\/p>\n<h4>5. Skip The Clean Up<\/h4>\n<p>Before Stories came into play, you do most of your marketing through posting and in time, you&#8217;ve already accumulated, countless posts on your account.\u00a0 It&#8217;s exhausting to look at, so you probably delete older posts.\u00a0 To avoid this, you can post to your Stories and just leave it like that, it will save you time and keep your feed uncluttered.<\/p>\n<h4>6.\u00a0\u00a0Reach Out<\/h4>\n<p>Aside from adding a hashtag to your Stories, you can also tag users.\u00a0 This gesture would make other people feel that they are cherished, an important person.\u00a0 For instance, you can tag some users when you have a promo, product launch or when you need inputs on your project.\u00a0 Making someone feel wanted and special has its rewards.<\/p>\n<h4>7. Go Unnoticed\u00a0<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2724 alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"252\" height=\"252\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-3.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-3-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-3-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-3-600x600.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 252px) 100vw, 252px\" \/><\/h4>\n<p>&#8220;Keep your friends close and your enemies closer&#8221; remains golden wherever and you can expect unwanted followers like competitors who want to be on top of the game and stay up to date on your every move.\u00a0 Sure you can block them but that also equates to losing a follower.\u00a0 Instead, you can choose to hide your Stories from certain people.<\/p>\n<h4>8. Shush Without The Fuss<\/h4>\n<p>Sometimes, it&#8217;s annoying to see and hear from someone all the time.\u00a0 But you don&#8217;t want to hurt their feelings so you just let them.\u00a0 It&#8217;s the same with Stories, some users would post something every hour and it is really tiring that you are tempted to click on that &#8216;Unfollow&#8217; button.\u00a0 Don&#8217;t do anything rash as they could easily click on that same button. As an alternative, you can just mute them, no big drama and the likes.<\/p>\n<h3>How To Maximize Your Stories<\/h3>\n<p>Now that you know what Stories can do for you, it&#8217;s time to focus on how you can utilize it with minimum effort.\u00a0 As always, planning is the key to everything, prepare a collection of quality contents and hashtags.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, you can use <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/jarvee-social-media-scheduler-features\/\">Jarvee<\/a> to automate this task for you and you can set it up in under 5 minutes through Campaigns.\u00a0 If you&#8217;ve been using this automation tool, then you should be quite familiar with how to add a post to your campaign, otherwise, you can read more about it <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/knowledge-base\/campaigns-what-to-publish\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>To make the campaign publish the post to your Stories, go to Campaign Overview tab and check the option &#8216;Post as part of your\u00a0story instead of on the wall&#8221; as seen on the image below.<\/p>\n<p>&#x1f4a1;\u00a0If you&#8217;ll be publishing the same image to multiple accounts, don&#8217;t forget to make the images unique.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2726\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-Campaign.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1233\" height=\"633\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-Campaign.png 1233w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-Campaign-300x154.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-Campaign-768x394.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-Campaign-1024x526.png 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-Campaign-600x308.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1233px) 100vw, 1233px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Next, you can navigate to the When To Publish tab and schedule when the campaign is going to publish the post.\u00a0 As mentioned, you can publish 2-3 Stories each day, so you can configure the settings in that manner.<\/p>\n<p>&#x1f4a1;\u00a0Being random is good, hence you can opt to randomize the publishing timers.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2727\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-Campaign-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1101\" height=\"577\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-Campaign-2.png 1101w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-Campaign-2-300x157.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-Campaign-2-768x402.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-Campaign-2-1024x537.png 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Jarvee-IG-Stories-Campaign-2-600x314.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1101px) 100vw, 1101px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So you have your posts and timers in place, you are almost ready to start the campaign but before you do that,\u00a0you can opt to tag users in your post.<\/p>\n<p>To do this, you can go back to Campaign Overview tab, click Advanced Settings button then navigate to the Instagram tab, check the option &#8216;Tag specific users in your post&#8217;
