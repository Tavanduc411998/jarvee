Being highly important in marketing, you must take proper care of it and perform your best in engaging more people in your business.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you are experienced in business or just <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/10-reasons-why-email-marketing-is-important-for-startups\/\">started a new company<\/a>, you might think it is quite hard to add new people to your list. At first glance, it seems hard. To be honest, it is much easier than you believe. Following the tricks below, you may achieve your goal to get more users to be on your email list.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start!<\/p>\n<h2>Show your value<\/h2>\n<p>No one likes subscribing to web pages and get spam letters. People must know why they should subscribe to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesagencycouncil\/2019\/05\/08\/why-are-email-newsletters-important-for-branding\/?sh=6c786f3b509f\">newsletter<\/a>. So, demonstrate it to them! Do not merely say things like \u201cSubscribe to our newsletter\u201d as every second web page does. It is not attractive at all, so avoid such cliches. What is the solution in this case?<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8193 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/show-your-value.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/show-your-value.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/show-your-value-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/show-your-value-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/show-your-value-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Give people something precious and unique. For instance, tell your visitors that some of your business special offers are sent to the email subscribers only. So, the only way to get any specific product may be implemented via email subscribing. Consider what are the valuable things you can give to your customers and find a way to attract their attention.<\/p>\n<p>Make your benefits clear so that everyone would understand the value of subscribing to your newsletter and answer to \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d kind of question easily. Also, your task is to determine the frequency of sending the e-letters as no one likes getting spam letters every day.<\/p>\n<h2>Encourage people to sign up<\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes, web pages \u201chide\u201d their option to join a mailing list. The button is hidden and you cannot find it at first glance. Of course, no one intends to keep an important email subscribing secret.<br \/>\nCheck if your email button is easy to find on the homepage, and your website visitors do not have to jump through obstacles to subscribe to your email updates. Otherwise, do not get surprised why people do not subscribe to your newsletter and the number of your current subscribers is low.<br \/>\nInclude a sign-up form on your web page, blog, or any other platform. To increase the chances, try to add a link to other relevant locations to attract more people.<\/p>\n<p>Simplify the sign-up process. First, get rid of any unimportant steps as all you need is the email address. The more steps the user must complete, the lower are chances they will finish the sign-up process. So, try to minimize the number of steps your visitor must do.<\/p>\n<h2>Make your email shareable and mobile-friendly<\/h2>\n<p>In 2021, a great number of promoters consider visual content highly important. People are likely to visit websites with a good visual more often and to spend more time scrolling them.<br \/>\nPay attention to small things. Start with creating an attractive email share button. Take care of the visual of your email and provide your customers with a user-friendly interface, which is pleasant to use.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8191 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/mobile-friendly-content.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/mobile-friendly-content.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/mobile-friendly-content-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/mobile-friendly-content-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/mobile-friendly-content-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Second, make it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.campaignmonitor.com\/blog\/email-marketing\/2019\/05\/mobile-friendly-email-tips\/\">mobile-friendly<\/a>. Are you aware of the fact that 50% of emails are opened on smartphones? Ensure your email design and content are mobile-friendly at every step. Making people rotate their phones back and forth, pinch and zoom is not the best idea.<br \/>\nMaking everything mobile-friendly, you increase chances to engage more subscribers to your email list. Besides, make sure all buttons are large enough to conveniently tap. People are more likely to complete the sign-up process if they have no trouble using your web page.<\/p>\n<h2>Show newsletter pop-up<\/h2>\n<p>You might already know that newsletter pop-ups capture website visitors\u2019 attention and help your business be more successful. Having implemented a subscription pop-up, you get more chances to attract users\u2019 attention to the events you would love them to notice.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8192 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/entertain-website-visitors.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/entertain-website-visitors.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/entertain-website-visitors-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/entertain-website-visitors-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/entertain-website-visitors-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>One of the ways to create an effective newsletter pop-up for achieving the right balance between the marketing goals and customer satisfaction is to select perfect timing. In this case, perfect timing is highly important as pop-ups are usually annoying, and may even make users leave the web page.<br \/>\nTo choose the best time to display a pop-up, focus on your company model. Test various methods and analyze which method works best for your website. You may try to show the pop-ups on your homepage, or when the visitor is surfing a specific section after some user engagement has occurred.<\/p>\n<p>Besides you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lianatech.com\/resources\/blog\/8-tips-to-personalize-your-emails.html\">personalize those newsletter pop-ups <\/a>with the help of cookie tracking. Personalizing is always a good idea for any kind of business. Using such a personalized way of approaching the right people at the right time increases your chances of achieving the goals. Newsletter pop-ups may appear only to first-time website users who haven\u2019t subscribed to your email newsletter yet, or individuals who have not clicked from your email campaigns.<\/p>\n<h2>Create a fun quiz<\/h2>\n<p>The last but not least trick is to provide your website users with some interactive content, which would capture their attention for sure. For instance, try to give your clients an entertaining quiz to finish. Is there anything better than to complete a fun quiz or survey while trying to find the information you need?<\/p>\n<p>Choose a related to your web page type of quiz, and make sending the results via email the only possible way to get them. Such interactive content helps to engage much more people and get a higher number of new email subscribers. If implementing such methods works for your website, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.leadquizzes.com\/blog\/quiz-ideas-and-titles\/\">create interactive quizzes<\/a> regularly. Be unique and apply some ideas no one has tried before.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>To bring significant benefits and make people want to subscribe to your email list, you should convince them of its value and never stop offering something special. People must clearly understand WHY they need one more email subscription in their inboxes. Give them a precise reply.<\/p>\n<p>Experiment with various methods, follow the latest design trends, and personalize as much as possible using the tools mentioned above. Interact your audience. And remember not to spam as it would spoil your relations with the website visitors and discourage them from subscribing to your newsletter.<\/p>\n<h2>About the author:<\/h2>\n<p>Debi J.
