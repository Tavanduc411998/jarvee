					<description><![CDATA[Measuring performance is very important, this way you know if you are doing the right thing or you subscribers are just feeling spammed with annoying content. We had to work on this since we didn&#039;t have enough knowledge about it, but we are still learning. Thank you for sharing!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really didn&#039;t know that the email marketing holds so high place on marketing strategies scale. I&#039;m not the fan of emails, but after reading this article I&#039;ll consider implementing this marketing strategy into my existing portfolio. I liked this article a lot, thanks for not letting me sleep tonight :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve not used the email feature in jarvee yet. I stay clear of email platforms like mailchimp, mailerlite these days, and came across a plugin for gmail business called gmass and it kinda dodges the promotions folder on a lot of the stuff I send out. Your right email is still a very effective tool and still allowed under GDPR guidelines in europe under the legitimate interest clause. With a google business account you can send out just under 2000 e-mails a day. It&#039;s important however to assure its not a new google business account and that it&#039;s an aged one when using plugins like gmass. Must look at the jarvee mail feature to see what it does.]]></description>
