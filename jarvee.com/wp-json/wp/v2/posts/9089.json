This is the dawn of digital life and made it easy as we can share anything with the world in a short period. Yes, that maybe is the primary goal of technologies, most especially with social media.<\/p>\n<p>Social Media has been with us for a couple of decades. Throughout those years, it has developed in many forms and transformed the lives of many, including the youth. Now, we cannot hide the fact that we can&#8217;t even think about how life would be and how we could reach every corner of the world without it.<\/p>\n<p>But why do youth become more dependent on Social Media today? What does it offer that we are hooked on it? Will we be able to live as it had never existed? Let us look at the bigger picture and dig deeper into this technical world we had created.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Negative Impact of Social Media on the Youth<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>We can consider <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/social-medias-influence-todays-youth\/\">social media as one vice of the youth today<\/a>, a severe addiction. Although it aims to make the world connected, it slowly becomes indispensable in their daily lives. Wherever you go, you&#8217;ll probably see a single youth who doesn&#8217;t know what social media is.<\/p>\n<p>As you walk on the street, almost all people, mostly the youth, keep scrolling on their social media accounts. While walking, riding a vehicle, sitting on a bench, buying in the supermarket, waiting in the line, and even when eating, they keep their heads down, looking right in front of their phones. Social media offers a lot of conveniences, but sometimes it is harming our lives. This platform turned out to be the digital drug of Millenials.<\/p>\n<p>It has a significant impact on the lives of people in this generation, likewise with the youth. For example, those who do nothing but remain online and stay connected to social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram are social media addicts. It disrupts the users&#8217; lives, and couldn&#8217;t do everyday things like household chores and spending quality time with the family and loved ones.<\/p>\n<p>Here you\u2019ll see that there is something funny about it. The fact that social media aims to make us all connected even in faraway places, why do we disconnect with the person who&#8217;s right in front of us?<\/p>\n<p>Besides, social media make the youth captivated. They seem to be friends with whom you can share sentiments and even react without a break. They express things through it no matter what they think and let others react the way they wanted. Yet as we can see, the youth today is very expressive and even those private things they share with the world.<\/p>\n<p>An online journal, maybe? Thus, this is quite risky, as there are many crimes made up of the use of social media. Many are misusing it in such a way that they are not aware of whether what they share affects others. Cyberbullying specifically is rampant today, and that is one negative impact of social media. Sadly, we can&#8217;t do anything about it but defend and lift those who are oppressed.<\/p>\n<p>We can find anything on social media; youth choose to read posts that read books. The long hours we spent on social media without feeling tired are not surprising anymore. Aside from that, they could even lose sleep because of it. It will delight them to keep updated on current trends and not let even a single one of them pass on their eyes without noticing.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, Social Media can be named as the drug of Millenials. Habitual inclination develops in those who are engaged in it. Almost all suffered from this newly invented kind of addiction. The saddest part is that we can&#8217;t do anything but witness how these people&#8217;s lives change every day.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Benefits of Social Media For The Youth<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Despite all the negative impacts, there are <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/changing-perceptions-reaping-the-benefits-of-social-media-use-in-the-work-environment\/\">benefits social media<\/a> has to offer.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Get in Touch with the World<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9091\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Get-in-Touch-with-the-World-.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Get-in-Touch-with-the-World-.png 517w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Get-in-Touch-with-the-World--300x191.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>First, it supports <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Digital_literacy\">digital media literacy<\/a>. We can access any certified news sources in a short time. We can browse and read and even share this news to make people aware wherever they are. Information dissemination will be much easier. Also, we can share info in a short period since it is a medium used for faster communication. We can easily share emergencies to save lives and help those who need help.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Educational Purpose and Useful Information<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Students could have access to almost all media platforms. They could learn from educational, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.teachthought.com\/technology\/10-different-social-media-sites-for-education\/\">social media platforms<\/a> where books and videos could be used. Searching for specific questions is easier, as it will bring them to a particular part without passing through other information that is not needed.<\/p>\n<p>Also, students will become more creative and innovative as they will learn more within the platform. They will gain more ideas they could use and promote more valuable output. They could also see that they could improve more than what they think of themselves.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Source of Income for Many People<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9092\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Source-of-Income-for-Many-People.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"423\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Source-of-Income-for-Many-People.png 582w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Source-of-Income-for-Many-People-300x211.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As we could see today, because of modernity, the market goes online now. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/274687\">People selling their items or products within the platform<\/a> will gain more attention than selling them on the market. It will also save them time and money, as it doesn&#8217;t cost that much as selling on-site.<\/p>\n<p>It is easy for them to reach their target customers. Wherever they will be, they will be easily accessible and get a reply in no time.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Develops Social Awareness<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Social media will be of great help to access the world. Places that have been under chaos will be delivered into the news on the platform. We can easily extend our support and call to what is happening and voice the voiceless.<\/p>\n<p>Social media becomes the medium to share sentiments that matter and be the start of change even in our homes&#8217; comfort. Today, youth have been actively participating in online calls to uphold the rights that have been neglected. Thus, we must be cautious when sharing pieces of information for our safety and security.<\/p>\n<p>Not just for freedom, other issues that encircle the world from environmental to personal problems, we can quickly be notified.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Incredible Platform to Showcase Talent<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>There are tons of videos online, and one wants to share their talents with the world. This is an excellent tool to gain more attention and support in this online world. Popularity will take place once you have been seen, same with the vloggers. They have been creating content for entertainment and by showing what they are.\u00a0 They showcase speaking skills in front of many people regardless of gender, age, and race.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Bottom Line<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mayoclinic.org\/healthy-lifestyle\/tween-and-teen-health\/in-depth\/teens-and-social-media-use\/art-20474437\">Social Media has its pros and cons<\/a>. Maybe it will differ from the person&#8217;s point of view. We cannot hide the fact that it helped most of us in every aspect, but sad to say; it has also been the nightmare of some. Maybe if we think of its purpose, then solely, we can see that it is a platform with great opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>The youth must get back to their senses that social media is a positive manifestation of advancement. It&#8217;s just that; it depends on how they will use it.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>About the Author<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-9093 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Sunny-Popli-.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"131\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Sunny-Popli-.png 290w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Sunny-Popli--229x300.png 229w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SPopli-193476494178364\">Sunny Popli<\/a> is the owner of <u><a href=\"https:\/\/spopli.com\/\">SPOPLI Web Development &amp; Services<\/a><\/u>.
