Most of the learners on SkillShare approach learning in a bit more casual way, so it\u2019s not ideal for serious businesses and traditional educational institutions.<\/p>\n<h2>7. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.learndash.com\/\">LearnDash<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>LearnDash is jam-packed with features that allow users to create detailed courses and extensive eLearning projects.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a plugin for WordPress sites, so you can create self-hosted courses and have full control over how and when you\u2019ll sell them.<\/p>\n<p>While it\u2019s a comprehensive solution, it features quite a learning curve and can be challenging to master.<\/p>\n<h2>8. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkific.com\/\">Thinkific <\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Thinkific is one of the favorites among online training software users because it\u2019s easy to get accustomed to, and allows you to create, update, and change your courses with ease.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you have no previous experience with eLearning authoring tools or course creation, you\u2019ll likely find Thinkific simple to use.<\/p>\n<p>Selling your courses online is a breeze, and you can use affiliate programs to enhance your marketing, as well as offer coupons and discounts to attract more customers.<\/p>\n<h2>9. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.talentlms.com\/\">TalentLMS <\/a><\/h2>\n<p>You can use the materials you already have and upload them to TalentLMS, or create and launch brand new online courses without a hitch.<\/p>\n<p>The software boasts all the necessary features that enhance your course creation process, and it can be integrated with various video conferencing tools as needed if you want to host live lessons.<\/p>\n<p>You can use Stripe or PayPal to sell your courses to global audiences.<\/p>\n<h2>10. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ispringsolutions.com\/ispring-learn\">iSpring Learn <\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Finally, iSpring Learn is designed to help create employee training courses but can be useful in educational institutions as well.<\/p>\n<p>Its greatest benefit is that it offers unlimited storage, which means that you can keep all of your courses available and continue selling and reselling them all without deleting old courses after you create new ones.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to use and get accustomed to and will provide you with all the tools you need to create and sell your own online courses.<\/p>\n<h2>The Bottom Line<\/h2>\n<p>Finding the right online training software to create and sell your own courses can be complicated as there are so many solutions available on the market.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the eLearning authoring tools mentioned here offer a free trial, so you should take advantage of it.
