					<description><![CDATA[Wow! Good one there! We&#039;ve all been waiting and thank God at least we have a brief relief to our anxiety. Nonetheless, I hope a form of compensation would be granted all the participants who sent essays that were in line with the guidelines (including the winner )in any manner, probably like a &#039;certificate of participation&#039; or something. Just saying.... Since there&#039;s no room for a runner up. Thanks Jarvee for this opportunity. Keep moving FORWARD!]]></description>
