					<description><![CDATA[Wow, amazing, I really didn&#039;t expect to win so this is mind-blowing! Since the announcement was delayed I didn&#039;t even check your blog, good thing I got your email today. Thank you very much for this opportunity and for picking me, this scholarship will make a huge difference. 

Also looking forward to reading what the others wrote about. Good luck to everyone competing for the runner-up prize!]]></description>
