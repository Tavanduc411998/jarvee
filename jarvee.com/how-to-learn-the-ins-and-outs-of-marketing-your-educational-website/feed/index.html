					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I am leaving this here because I am not receiving a response from the support team. I signed up for a month long, subscription to Jarvee for 30 dollars. I was charged on the 8th of April. Since then, the program has continually denied me access, saying my license is expired. Can I either receive a 5 day extension or refund? Thanks,]]></description>
