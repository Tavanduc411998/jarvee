In fact, when it comes to receiving\u00a0 permission-based promotional messages, <a href=\"http:\/\/image.exct.net\/lib\/fe641570776d02757515\/m\/1\/SFF14-The2012ChannelPreferenceSurvey.pdf\">77% of people<\/a> would rather get them through email. This is opposed to other channels like SMS, phone, direct mail or even social media.<\/p>\n<p>All that remains is to get it right. Building a beautiful and responsive website, selecting one of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/web-hosting\/best-web-hosting-service-websites\">best hosting providers<\/a> and getting people to subscribe to your mailing list is half the battle. What you need to do next is get people to engage with your brand through your emails.<\/p>\n<p>However, this is easier said than done. Many brands have tried sending emails only to get no results. This is because the efforts that they are putting into the campaign are lackluster. Furthermore, people receive tons of emails from other brands fighting for their attention. One can easily see why getting right is essential.<\/p>\n<p>To get better open rates and stay ahead of the curve, follow these six email marketing best practices.<\/p>\n<h2>1.Make Sure the Email Content is Relevant<\/h2>\n<p>The easiest way to lose an audience you have worked so hard to get is to send them irrelevant content. Remember, every email client these days has a spam filter. Do not think for one moment that your readers will not click the spam button once they sense an irrelevant email.<\/p>\n<p>So how do you make sure that you are sending your readers content they will find relevant? Follow this quick tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Curate the content<\/strong> \u2013 Locate or create content that you believe will be relevant and engaging to your audience and put it in the email.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make it personal<\/strong> \u2013 That way, the email has personality and is more relatable.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make it useful<\/strong> \u2013 As an expert in your niche, you can engage your audience more and maintain your email list by providing your audience with helpful and actionable content.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Watch your competition <\/strong>\u2013 Subscribe to your competitor\u2019s email list and find out what they are sending their subscribers. If their content is useful and relevant, you can learn a lot from it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>2. Write an Effective Welcome Email<\/h2>\n<p>The best email marketing campaign is one that focuses on <strong>building and sustaining relationships with new and existing customers. <\/strong>That is why a welcome email is important since that is what sets the tone for the relationship.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5053\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/write-an-effective-welcome-email.jpg\" alt=\"write an effective welcome email\" width=\"624\" height=\"332\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/write-an-effective-welcome-email.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/write-an-effective-welcome-email-300x160.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/write-an-effective-welcome-email-600x319.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As soon as someone signs up, send them an email. You might want to do this right away because your business will still be fresh in the person\u2019s mind. All that remains is to make sure the welcome emails is effective.<\/p>\n<p>Here is how you do it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Make it personal<\/strong> \u2013 Make sure it contains the person\u2019s name.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Introduce yourself<\/strong> \u2013 Briefly describe to the recipient what you are all about.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Avoid no-reply emails<\/strong> \u2013 Give the subscriber a chance to respond to the email.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Tell them what to expect<\/strong> \u2013 Tell them what content you will be sending them and the frequency of your emails. This is your chance to meet their expectations, which is very important.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>3. Track Open Rates and Clicks<\/h2>\n<p>Who is engaging with your emails and who isn\u2019t? These are important metrics to know, making this tip one of the email marketing best practices to try.<strong> If you don\u2019t measure the performance of your campaign, you basically won\u2019t know if it is succeeding or failing.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For example, by tracking open rates and clicks, you can know which type of content your recipients respond to the most. This way, if you are doing some right, you can keep it up. And if you are doing something wrong, you can take the necessary action to increase the open rates and clicks.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Don\u2019t Send Too Many Emails<\/h2>\n<p>Sending your recipients irrelevant emails isn\u2019t the only way to force them to use their spam filter or unsubscribe from the mailing list. Sometimes, <strong>sending them too many emails can be considered spammy behavior. <\/strong>You can come off as an annoyance, which they would want to get rid of right away.<\/p>\n<p>You want to engage people, not annoy them.<\/p>\n<p>These days, you can let your subscribers pick how often they want to receive emails. (Bombarding them with emails is far from the best way to ensure engagement). By doing so, you will be able to better engage with your recipients instead of getting blocked or unsubscribe.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Test the Content of the Email<\/h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t just send out an email the moment you finish typing it. Make sure you preview it first to make sure that everything is working. Make sure things like all the images are showing and that all links are working properly (no broken links).<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5054\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/test-the-content-of-the-email.jpg\" alt=\"test the content of the email\" width=\"624\" height=\"311\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/test-the-content-of-the-email.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/test-the-content-of-the-email-300x150.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/test-the-content-of-the-email-600x299.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/test-the-content-of-the-email-573x285.jpg 573w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you are using email marketing tools like <u><a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/\">MailChimp<\/a><\/u>, for example, one of the best email marketing practices is to send one to yourself. After you confirm everything is in order, send the email to your recipients.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Find out Who Still Wants to Receive Emails from You<\/h2>\n<p>Sure, the person has subscribed to your email list, but that still doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t confirm if they are still interested in receiving emails. So before you send them any email that markets your products or services, send them one asking if they are still interested.<\/p>\n<p>This is one of the email best practices because it helps you build a clean list (list of people wanting and willing to engage with your content). <strong>Provide them with a link that will allow them to unsubscribe in case they are no longer interested.<\/strong> Place it somewhere in the footer of your email.<\/p>\n<h2>Learn from Email Marketing Best Practices<\/h2>\n<p>Email marketing is one of the best ways to engage with potential customers. But many people don\u2019t do it right and end up not seeing good results. This is because they are not following the email marketing best practices that lead to high email open rates.<\/p>\n<p>Considering that email yields a <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.quicksprout.com\/email-metrics\/\">higher return on investment (ROI)<\/a><\/u> compared to other marketing channels, you need to do it right. So be sure to try to the email marketing best practices mentioned above. Particularly, making sure the content is relevant and that your are not spamming your audience.<\/p>\n<p>By following these best practices, you can rest assured knowing that you know how to do email marketing properly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the author:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5058\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Rick_portrait-2.jpg\" alt=\"Rick_portrait \" width=\"109\" height=\"109\" \/>Rick has been a part of the content marketing industry for 10 years since 2009.
