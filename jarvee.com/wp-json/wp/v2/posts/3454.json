It&#8217;s always better to have a little refreshment on marketing tactics that can benefit your brand.<\/p>\n<p>With that said, let\u2019s start with our Facebook marketing tip #1:<\/p>\n<h2>1. Repurpose And Re-share Your Top Performing Content.<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3471 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/top-performance-content.jpg\" alt=\"facebook marketing tips top performing content\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/top-performance-content.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/top-performance-content-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/top-performance-content-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/top-performance-content-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It can be challenging to stay consistent at putting forth brand new content every other day. Thus, the point of re-sharing content on Facebook is to save time and resources.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll probably have a lot of doubts about this. However, there is no harm in re-sharing your content across Facebook. Take a look at the top brands and publishers on Facebook and observe their Facebook strategy. One thing that&#8217;s very apparent is that they&#8217;re sharing top posts that have performed well on their Facebook page in the past.<\/p>\n<p>To help put this in perspective a little bit, if you take a look at the actual data, only about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.haleymarketing.com\/2016\/09\/15\/facebook-organic-reach\/\">2-5%<\/a> of your audience is actually going to see any given piece of content that you post. Meaning 95-98% of your audience isn&#8217;t seeing your content at all, so this proves that there isn&#8217;t any harm in re-sharing content to Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>A good rule of thumb for re-sharing content to Facebook is to wait 3-4 weeks before you publish a certain piece of content.<\/p>\n<p>Ideally, you&#8217;ll have a never-ending supply of great content that you can post on your page. Especially when done in tandem with curated content.<\/p>\n<h2>2.

Facebook Groups<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-3462 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/facebook-groups.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/facebook-groups.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/facebook-groups-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/facebook-groups-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/facebook-groups-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Facebook Groups are still a huge opportunity for brands and businesses to build a massive community around a vertical. However, a lot of times Facebook Groups tend to be ignored by people. Either because they don&#8217;t know how powerful Facebook Groups are, or they just don&#8217;t have the time or resources dedicated to building a thriving community.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in marketing to Facebook Groups, here are a few tips you can follow.<\/p>\n<p>1. Start with a niche and build a small, highly dedicated, highly active community around that specific topic. In other words, don&#8217;t try to be everything for everyone. Build your group around a topic that is very specific to serving customers needs.<\/p>\n<p>2. Ask yourself, what are your audiences pain points? What if people asked you about your business on a regular basis? What are the top questions on Quora in your industry?<\/p>\n<p>Those all make for great topic ideas to use in your Facebook group.<\/p>\n<p>Your Facebook group will start out small but the key is to avoid using it to sell your products from the very beginning. Your group should be centered around value, education, and usefulness. Believe it or not, the less you sell your product to your group&#8217;s members, the more attractive your products will be.<\/p>\n<p>If you provide people useful, relevant content that helps solve their challenges, you&#8217;re going to get more customers. Not through talking about yourself all the time. When it comes to building a successful Facebook group, you have to remember that it will take a lot of time and dedication to making sure that it is successful.<\/p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/5-ways-maximize-facebook-traffic-jarvee\/\">article<\/a> shows you how you can use Jarvee to find niche-relevant Facebook groups to get inspiration from or to share your content with.
