Facebook has no character limit yet the best content length for it is just around 40 characters while Twitter\u00a0which decided to stick with 280 limit character has an ideal content length of up to 100 characters only.<\/p>\n<p>The purpose of content is to be able to promote your business or brand in all available channels across social media without spending a lot of money for promoting your business. Knowing the criteria or limitations when\u00a0making content\u00a0saves you time, money and effort.<\/p>\n<h3>Optimal Length for Your Social Content<\/h3>\n<h4>Twitter tweet &#8211; \u00a071 to 100 characters only<\/h4>\n<p>Twitter has a 280 character limit now. It leaves space for your URL and for re-tweets and quotes. But according to Buddy Media, tweets with lengths lower than 100 characters are\u00a017% more likely to engage readers\u00a0over tweets with more than 100 characters.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/promoting-your-travel-agency-on-twitter.jpg\" alt=\"promoting-your-travel-agency-on-twitter\" width=\"293\" height=\"288\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2539\" \/><\/p>\n<p>No one is more authorized to tell you what content length works best for your tweets except Twitter itself. Both <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3028656\/work-smart\/the-proven-ideal-length-of-every-tweet-facebook-post-and-headline-online\">Buddy Media and Track Social study <\/a>on 100 well-known brands on Twitter found out that tweets with 71-100 characters are shared or re-tweeted more.<\/p>\n<p>These tweets are the medium length which gives room for comments from followers who would be sharing the tweets.<\/p>\n<h4>Facebook post- 40 characters only<\/h4>\n<p>Facebook may not have imposed a character limit like\u00a0Twitter\u00a0but posts with 40 characters only have 86% higher engagement rate than longer Facebook posts.<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/promoting-your-travel-agency-on-facebook.jpg\" alt=\"promoting-your-travel-agency-on-facebook\" width=\"370\" height=\"231\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2525\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/promoting-your-travel-agency-on-facebook.jpg 370w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/promoting-your-travel-agency-on-facebook-300x187.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\" \/><br \/>\nOn Facebook, posts with image perform 120% better than posts with plain texts only but in order for text posts to generate better engagement rate, it has to be about 40 characters long only.<\/p>\n<p>Jeff Bullas did a study of retail brands on Facebook and based on likes and comments, 40 character posts have the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3028656\/work-smart\/the-proven-ideal-length-of-every-tweet-facebook-post-and-headline-online\">highest engagement activity<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Another study conducted by BlitzLocal on 120 billion Facebook impressions have validated that the longer the post, the less engagement activity it gets. Facebook it seems love brevity.<\/p>\n<h4>Google+- 60 characters only<\/h4>\n<p>Ideally, your Google+ headline must be compelling enough to\u00a0entice your readers to read through your content simply by just looking at your headline.<\/p>\n<p>A headline should be on one line only as that&#8217;s the breaking point for\u00a0Google+. If a longer headline cannot be avoided, then your first sentence must be very interesting to urge readers to continue reading your\u00a0Google+ post.<\/p>\n<p>You might ask what the rationale is behind the need for a killer first sentence. This is because\u00a0Google+ is created in such a way that readers will only get to see the first 3 lines of the entire post before the Read More button becomes visible.<\/p>\n<h3>Optimal Length for Blog Posts<\/h3>\n<h4>LinkedIn post-25 words<\/h4>\n<p>The limit on words would actually depend on your target audience. For the B2B audience, it is between 16-25 words while B2C is between 21-25 words. This is based on a Compendium study on 200 companies that focused on the clicks in checking for the ideal length of the headline.<\/p>\n<h4>Blog post headline- 6 words<\/h4>\n<p>Based on a 2009 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nngroup.com\/articles\/first-2-words-a-signal-for-scanning\/\">usability testing<\/a> conducted by Jakob Nielsen, only the first 11 characters of a headline are consumed by readers. Why 6 words? An average person only sees the first and last 3 words of a headline.<\/p>\n<h4>Blog post- 1600 words which is equivalent to 7 minutes<\/h4>\n<p>Medium based their\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3028656\/work-smart\/the-proven-ideal-length-of-every-tweet-facebook-post-and-headline-online\">study on the time or attention<\/a>\u00a0provided to the article and not on the number of clicks the blog post has received.<\/p>\n<p>Posts with 1600 words receive higher engagement hence it has become the limit. An article\u00a0with only 1000 words is considered acceptable providing that the blog post is full of images.<\/p>\n<p>Other studies would dispute the results of Medium&#8217;s statistical research; Moz&#8217;s result for their own website produced better engagement for posts longer than 7 minutes. Similarly, the paragraphs on your post should consist of only 40-55 characters for easier readability.<\/p>\n<p>Opening paragraphs with larger fonts than the rest make it easy for the readers to focus and read the blog post. To make your blog post\u00a0optimized for search engines, including 6 hashtags without special characters.<\/p>\n<h3>Optimal Length for Videos<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/social-media-video.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"941\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2552\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/social-media-video.jpeg 1500w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/social-media-video-300x188.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/social-media-video-768x482.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/social-media-video-1024x642.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/01\/social-media-video-600x376.jpeg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>YouTube video- 3 minutes length only<\/h4>\n<p>Based on the top 50 videos on YouTube, the most popular have an average length of 2:50. Other studies reveal that a maximum length of 3:30 is still acceptable.<\/p>\n<h4>Podcast video- 22 minutes length only<\/h4>\n<p>An average listener of Podcast normally spends about 22 minutes for every video. Students lose interest in the video once they hit the 15-20-minute mark.<\/p>\n<h3>Other Content Limits<\/h3>\n<h4>SlideShare Presentation- 61 slides<\/h4>\n<p>An in-depth SlideShare presentation following proper guidelines\u00a0has about 61 slides. On average, that&#8217;s about 6 minutes worth of presentation.<\/p>\n<h4>Pinterest Image &#8211; 735 x 1102px<\/h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Multiple-Pinterest.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1742\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Multiple-Pinterest.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Multiple-Pinterest-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/Multiple-Pinterest-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Pins should be 735 x 1102px. In your feeds, the pins would have the size of 235 px. The aspect ratio could either be 1:3.5 or 2:3 with a minimum width of 600. If your width is at 800 px, your length could either be 2800 px or 1200 px to satisfy Pinterest&#8217;s aspect ratio\u00a0(relationship of an image&#8217;s height to its width).<\/p>\n<h3>Wrapping it Up<\/h3>\n<p>So what&#8217;s the purpose of content limit? This can be attributed more to search engine optimization more than anything else as the content lengths were determined based on in-depth studies conducted on the different social platforms. Search engine rankings and readability are the reasons why it is important for you to know what the acceptable content limits are for every network.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, your aim here is to get more followers and customers to attain higher sales conversions in order for your business to grow and prosper.\u00a0The more followers you have, the better your chances are for converting sales.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you know that there is an acceptable length for every type of content you make to optimize its readability and its SEO ranking?
