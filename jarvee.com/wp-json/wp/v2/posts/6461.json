Tell Your Brand\u2019s Story<\/h2>\n<p>People are inquisitive in nature &#8211; it is a common human nature.<\/p>\n<p>They are always tempted to know more about the people they are connecting with and the brands they are dealing with. And as a business, it is your duty to quench their curiosity.<\/p>\n<p>To build more connections and strengthen relationships, use LinkedIn video to tell your brand story. Include interesting tidbits about your company, story behind your business, or share the events that motivated you to open your business.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, videos rank highly in LinkedIn\u2019s algorithms, which is why you have a better chance to reach your target audience and attract more audience for your business with LinkedIn videos than with any other form of content.<\/p>\n<p>Sharing your brand\u2019s story with your LinkedIn connections will help you boost your online presence, increase brand foothold, and build a personal relationship with your customers.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Shared Curated Information<\/h2>\n<p>You don\u2019t necessarily need to always create brand new videos to share with your network.<\/p>\n<p>Your goal is to share something that engages your audience and is of some value to them, which is why you can curate all the important things and compile videos on its basis.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some things that you can talk about in the videos:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Podcast that you recently listened to and resonated with you.<\/li>\n<li>Share something about the books you recently read and something that what are the things that you liked about them.<\/li>\n<li>Have you learned something new regarding your business today? If yes, then share it in your next LinkedIn video<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can also livestream a video of an event the next time you visit an important conference or business event. You can either record some parts of the event to share with people in your network or even make a quick video talking about the things you learned in the event that you think is worth sharing.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Share Your Office Culture<\/h2>\n<p>You can also share occasional videos that show what goes on behind the scenes and how your office culture works like.<\/p>\n<p>Such videos are also easy to shoot and you don\u2019t have to brainstorm for new ideas either. It will also help you attract your prospects towards your brand on a more personal level.<\/p>\n<p>And not just a general work culture video, create videos that give special coverage to your employees as well.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, this welding company posted a video on LinkedIn that showcased a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/update\/urn:li:activity:6370049681824718848\">special talent<\/a> of one of their new employees.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Share-Your-Office-Culture.jpg\" alt=\"Share Your Office Culture \" width=\"552\" height=\"678\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6463\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Share-Your-Office-Culture.jpg 552w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Share-Your-Office-Culture-244x300.jpg 244w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 552px) 100vw, 552px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The video got massive engagement and grabbed the attention of thousands of LinkedIn users, as is apparent from its comments and likes.<\/p>\n<p>When you share such videos on LinkedIn, they help in giving your brand a human touch.<\/p>\n<p>And customers today are more attracted to personal experiences and direct connection other than the bland approach to sales.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Host Q&amp;A Style Interviews<\/h2>\n<p>Sharing stories and monologues on camera is not for everyone. Some people can find it a bit intimidating.<\/p>\n<p>But it is nothing to worry about! You have plenty of other options to engage your audience using LinkedIn video marketing.<\/p>\n<p>Try to get in touch with professionals and influencers in your industry and conduct a Q&amp;A session with them.<\/p>\n<p>One option is to host such Q&amp;A Style Interviews in person with all the proper equipment, professional studio, and more.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/coffeewithkyles\/\">Connected with Kyle<\/a> on LinkedIn is one great example:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Host-QA-Style-Interviews.jpg\" alt=\"Host Q&amp;A Style Interviews \" width=\"548\" height=\"666\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6464\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Host-QA-Style-Interviews.jpg 548w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Host-QA-Style-Interviews-247x300.jpg 247w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is a weekly video series hosted by Kyle Burt on LinkedIn. The videos consist of interviews with interesting and influencing people from the business technology domain.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure that you do extensive research before the interview. Ask important questions that you think are relevant to your audience.<\/p>\n<p>There is no need to be all professional either. Your aim is not to bore your audience to death. Your questions should be equally focused on technical know-how as well as the backstory of the person you are interviewing.<\/p>\n<p>If you are having a hard time arranging an in-person interview, then record a video call. But use high-quality, popular video recording tools to ensure great quality.<\/p>\n<h2>Summing it all up<\/h2>\n<p>LinkedIn video marketing is still new and yet untapped by many marketing professionals , but it has already proved its mettle.<\/p>\n<p>LinkedIn videos are great when it comes to engaging your audience. But before you devise your whole video marketing strategy, develop a video style beforehand. From candid videos articulating important trivia to Q&amp;A, there are a lot of options that you can choose from.<\/p>\n<p>Apart from the LinkedIn video style, it is also important to remain consistent in your efforts. If you abandon your video marketing activities or post videos at unequal days, then your audience will also abandon you.<\/p>\n<p>So use these LinkedIn marketing tips to engage your audience, skyrocket your sales and create a buzz around your brand.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the author<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/deepti-jain.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"136\" height=\"136\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6465\" \/>Deepti Jain is an engineering student who has a knack for writing and is currently working at <a href=\"https:\/\/aeroleads.com\/\">AeroLeads<\/a> at the post of Content Writer.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Something special has been happening in the field of marketing these past years.
