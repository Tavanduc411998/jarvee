Local service ads feature encompasses limited home service segments. This program ensures a satisfactory delivery of services to the customers.<\/p>\n<h2>How Can a Local Business Get Listed on Google Guaranteed?<\/h2>\n<p>To be a part of this program does not require much hassle. There is an advanced verification system that you have to go through. Plus, before becoming a member of Google Guaranteed, you have to get hold of Local Services ads.<\/p>\n<p>This helps enlighten the customers about your information, including address, reviews, contact details, and other stuff. After completing this task, you need to pass the background check and later verify your insurance and license. After the completion of the process, a badge will be exhibited next to your Ad.<\/p>\n<h2>Things to Keep in Mind<\/h2>\n<p>Before passing the screening test, you need to keep some fundamental points in your mind.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The license and insurance of your business must be bonafide<\/li>\n<li>Get a Google My Business Page and keep up with its maintenance regularly<\/li>\n<li>Engage with the customers and request them to write reviews for your services<\/li>\n<li>When your industry gets included in the Google Guaranteed list, register in the first go<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You need to keep in mind after getting registered that the journey doesn&#8217;t end here. Even after getting the Google Guaranteed Badge, you need to keep with the rules and maintain it properly. If not, your badge may be repealed.<\/p>\n<h2>How is Google Guaranteed Rewarding for Local Businesses?<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9650\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Google-Guaranteed-Rewarding-for-Local-Businesses.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Google-Guaranteed-Rewarding-for-Local-Businesses.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Google-Guaranteed-Rewarding-for-Local-Businesses-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Google-Guaranteed-Rewarding-for-Local-Businesses-600x399.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There is a reason why several local businesses are heading towards this recently developed platform. Precisely because it harbors a wide range of benefits for them.<\/p>\n<h3>Powerful Lead Generation<\/h3>\n<p>Once you register for this program and get your badge, get ready for a robust online lead generation. With its help, the marketing process will be stimulated, and more people will be able to get to know about your local business.<\/p>\n<h3>Earn the Trust of Customers<\/h3>\n<p>If you have a Google Guaranteed Badge, people will start looking at you with the feeling of trust.

On Google My Business, the customer can only see the name and number of the local service. While on Google Guaranteed, he can gain access to the address, contact details, reviews, and many other points.<\/p>\n<h3>Confidence in Contractors<\/h3>\n<p>When a customer sees a business listing on GMB along with the Google Guaranteed Badge, his trust in the contractor increases tenfold. It is because of the verification process that Google carries before adding any business to its list.<\/p>\n<p>Hence, the customers already know they are not going to get disappointed with the services. Even if they do, they will always get justice in the end. <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.orbitlocal.com\/resources\/how-to-get-google-guaranteed\/\">A guide from orbit local<\/a><\/u> points out how a customer has the right to ask for a refund if he is not satisfied with your work.<\/p>\n<h3>Reimbursement Criteria<\/h3>\n<p>This feature gives a sense of security and arouses feelings of trust in the Google Guaranteed. Suppose a customer is not satisfied with the contractor&#8217;s work. In that case, Google will not only give him his money back but will also provide a lifetime cap of coverage up to CAD 2,000 in Canada and USD 2000 in America.<\/p>\n<p>However, there are eligibility criteria for this service as well. It is only applicable when you use Google Assistant or Local Service to book a service. Plus, you have to claim it within 30 days of the completion of the service. In addition, a receipt is essential that comprises all the payment details and the provider&#8217;s business name.<\/p>\n<h2>Categories for Reimbursement<\/h2>\n<p>You can not claim a refund every time you want to. Only the following categories are open to this service:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Trip Charges<\/li>\n<li>Diagnostic Fees<\/li>\n<li>Damage to property<\/li>\n<li>Responsiveness of the business<\/li>\n<li>Cancellations<\/li>\n<li>Add-ons<\/li>\n<li>Dissatisfaction with the price<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Are All Industries Eligible for Google Guaranteed?<\/h2>\n<p>The only downside of Google Guaranteed is that it is not available for all types of businesses yet. However, it is expanding its circle with time. In most regions of the US and Canada, this service is present.<\/p>\n<p>The list of eligible businesses varies from region to region. In Canada, HVAC companies are eligible to be listed. These include heating, ventilation, and air conditioning companies. Along with it, plumbing businesses and locksmith services are also supported by Google Guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>In the US, the list is quite comprehensive. It generally includes auto repair, appliance repair, locksmith services,<u><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Photography\"> photography<\/a><\/u>, window cleaning, water damage restoration, HVAC, car repair, junk removal, pest control companies, pet grooming, tree service, roof service, pet brooding, event planners, electricians, house cleaning, carpet cleaning, house cleaning, and garage door installer.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>What makes Google Guaranteed worthwhile is the fact that it brings a wide range of customers your way. The world is full of local businesses and competing with them effectively is not always easy. If your ads are highlighted through this program, you are more likely to succeed.<\/p>\n<p>This makes it a wise and healthy choice. The customers will spend money on your services without having any second doubts in the head.
