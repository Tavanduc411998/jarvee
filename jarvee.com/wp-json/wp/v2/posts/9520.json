If you target the wrong audience, your ads will become irrelevant, and nobody will click on them.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to make everything as personalized as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Personalization is critical to the success of your ads. No wonder Facebook gives you that many options for targeting and specifying your audience.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9527\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Why-Your-Facebook-Ads-May-Not-Be-Giving-The-Result-You-Wanted-wrong-audience.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"352\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Why-Your-Facebook-Ads-May-Not-Be-Giving-The-Result-You-Wanted-wrong-audience.png 602w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Why-Your-Facebook-Ads-May-Not-Be-Giving-The-Result-You-Wanted-wrong-audience-300x175.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Why-Your-Facebook-Ads-May-Not-Be-Giving-The-Result-You-Wanted-wrong-audience-600x351.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You should also set a goal of what you\u2019re trying to achieve &#8211; do you want to increase awareness or close more deals?<\/p>\n<p>You can easily do that by focusing on <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freedomtoascend.com\/entrepreneurship\/what-is-a-sales-funnel\/\">the specific sales funnel stages<\/a><\/u>.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9526\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales-funnel.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"344\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales-funnel.png 602w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales-funnel-300x171.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/sales-funnel-600x343.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>While in the Awareness stage, you\u2019re mainly introducing your brand to the leads. You\u2019re doing all of the selling in the Decision stage instead.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure you\u2019re aware of what sales funnel stage your customers are at.<\/p>\n<p>Tailor your Facebook ads to them, make everything as relevant as possible, and drive stranger results faster.<\/p>\n<h2>#2 Your Ad\u2019s Quality is Low<\/h2>\n<p>The quality of your ad is critical if you\u2019re looking to launch a successful Facebook ad campaign. That\u2019s why you should pay close attention to the grammar, type of content, and tone of voice.<\/p>\n<p>Crafting nicely written ads that are grammatically correct is especially important. This is because just <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.figmentagency.com\/blog\/mistakes-happen-but-how-much-could-a-spelling-mistake-cost-your-business\/\">one small grammar error can cost you 50% in sales<\/a><\/u>.<\/p>\n<p>You should also figure out a way to stand among other posts and ads in the feed. An easy way to do that is to use videos and images to get more attention with your ads.<\/p>\n<p>You can easily set different types of Facebook ads in the Ads Manager.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9529\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Your-Ads-Quality-is-Low.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"151\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Your-Ads-Quality-is-Low.png 602w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Your-Ads-Quality-is-Low-300x75.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Your-Ads-Quality-is-Low-600x150.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Just make sure you use the right tools to maximize its effectiveness and convey the right message (<u><a href=\"https:\/\/colinshipp.com\/video-marketing-tools\/\">here are my best picks for that<\/a><\/u>.)<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, you can\u2019t forget to include a CTA. It\u2019s the key thing that leads to the most sales. If you don\u2019t show your customers where to buy, how do you expect to make sales?<\/p>\n<p>You should also make it more relevant instead of leaving it to just <em>\u201cClick here.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em> <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9524\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/include-CTA.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/include-CTA.png 602w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/include-CTA-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/include-CTA-600x299.png 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/include-CTA-573x285.png 573w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Perfecting the quality and making everything spot on will go a long way. It will help you maximize your ad\u2019s potential and supercharge your sales.<\/p>\n<h2>#3 Your Bid Is Too Low<\/h2>\n<p>When you launch a Facebook ads campaign, you\u2019re competing with thousands of similar brands trying to get to the same audience.<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s why Facebook needs to decide which ads will show and which will not.<\/p>\n<p>This ad\u2019s ranking is based on not only price, though. The most important Facebook ads ranking factors include:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Bid Price<\/strong> &#8211; how much money you pay for your ads<\/li>\n<li><strong>Action Rates<\/strong> &#8211; how many actions users took from your ads. This is sometimes only an estimation.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Quality &amp; relevance<\/strong> &#8211; how relevant and high-quality your ad is. The more, the better.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You don\u2019t always need to bid the highest price to get on top. That\u2019s why I strongly advise you to perfect the quality, make your ads relevant, and include a strong CTA in the previous section.<\/p>\n<p>That way, you spend less, earn more, and have a more successful ad campaign.<\/p>\n<p>But because the price is very important, you need to figure out how much you should pay Facebook for each action. You have two options you can set in terms of pricing.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re just a beginner, I recommend you choose the <strong>Lowest Cost <\/strong>option.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9522\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/bid-is-too-low.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"545\" height=\"147\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/bid-is-too-low.png 545w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/bid-is-too-low-300x81.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>That allows you to let Facebook determine the lowest price you need to pay to show up in the Facebook feed.<\/p>\n<p>On the opposite spectrum, you have the <strong>Bid Cap<\/strong> option.<\/p>\n<p>The Bid Cap option allows you to choose prices according to your needs. It\u2019s the price that you\u2019re willing to pay, and you have complete control of it.<\/p>\n<p>But this is risky because if you set an extremely low price, you risk not showing up.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9521\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/bid-cap.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"191\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/bid-cap.png 602w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/bid-cap-300x95.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/bid-cap-600x190.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So be aware of that and don\u2019t always try to spend as little as possible. Understand that if you spend a bit more, you can get more money in return than if you spent a lot less.<\/p>\n<h2>#4 You Set Far Too Big Goals<\/h2>\n<p>Setting unrealistic goals and expecting too much from yourself isn\u2019t something rare. In fact, it\u2019s natural that you strive to achieve the best results.<\/p>\n<p>But you must make sure they are within your reach and not impossible to accomplish.<\/p>\n<p>Setting goals that are out of your reach will only frustrate you and make you wonder what the heck is wrong with your ad campaign. Fixing it isn\u2019t as straightforward as possible, though\u2026<\/p>\n<p>The easiest way to fix it is to hire an expert or an industry leader to look at your ad campaign and set realistic goals for you.<\/p>\n<p>The more experience they have, the higher the chances of actually accomplishing the goals.<\/p>\n<p>I highly advise you to do so for your ad campaign, especially if you\u2019re just starting and have no prior experience on the subject. It will simplify your life, take away all of the headaches, and help you <u><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/social-media-marketing-tips\/\">set more realistic goals<\/a><\/u> that you can accomplish.<\/p>\n<h2>#5 Your Account Spending Limit Has Been Reached<\/h2>\n<p>When you work with Facebook Ads, each ad group and campaign has a spending limit that you can put in place.<\/p>\n<p>This limit is here to help you assign a specific amount of resources to the individual ads.<\/p>\n<p>You usually set this limit in the beginning when you\u2019re creating an ad campaign. And if you\u2019re like most people, you forget about it after a while because you have tons of other tasks to take care of.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that means that if you go over this limit, your ads won\u2019t show up.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9528\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Your-Account-Spending-Limit-Has-Been-Reached.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"232\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Your-Account-Spending-Limit-Has-Been-Reached.png 602w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Your-Account-Spending-Limit-Has-Been-Reached-300x116.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Your-Account-Spending-Limit-Has-Been-Reached-600x231.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, fixing it is super easy. You just need to go to the settings of your ad campaign and set a higher spending limit. It\u2019s always a great idea to double-check it. It\u2019s a super-simple thing that can be easily overlooked and cause trouble.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure to check your spending limit, set the right amounts, and deliver your ads.<\/p>\n<h2>#6 Your Landing Page Isn\u2019t Optimized<\/h2>\n<p>Clicking on the Facebook ad is only the beginning of a sales cycle. If you wish to make a sale, you\u2019ll need more than just clicks.<\/p>\n<p>The rest happens on your landing page &#8211; the page where you sell your products.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s critical that you set clear goals for your landing page, optimize it for your customers, and do everything in your power to maximize its conversion rate.<\/p>\n<p>The average <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.impactplus.com\/blog\/what-is-a-good-landing-page-conversion-rate\">conversion rate for a landing page is 2.35%<\/a><\/u>.<\/p>\n<p>If your conversion rate is lower, you should start paying closer attention to your landing page. Maybe you don\u2019t convey a strong benefit, need to add more social proof, or just should use a different hook.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever it is, make sure you fix it to reach the full potential of your landing page.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, nowadays it\u2019s easier than ever with tools like ClickFunnels. You can do everything effortlessly with a drag-and-drop editor and build a solid landing page in a matter of a few hours.

The only thing they care about is themselves and how the product can help them.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s precisely the difference between benefits and features.<\/p>\n<p>While features tell your customers all about the product, benefits tell them how they can profit from buying it and why they should do so.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9523\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Dont-Convey-a-Strong-Benefit.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"376\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Dont-Convey-a-Strong-Benefit.png 602w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Dont-Convey-a-Strong-Benefit-300x187.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/Dont-Convey-a-Strong-Benefit-600x375.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to run a successful Facebook ad campaign, you must make all of your ads benefit-driven.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s the only way to convey the right message, <u><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/advanced-facebook-ads-strategies-for-getting-more-customers\/\">persuade your customers<\/a><\/u>, and make sales.<\/p>\n<h2>#8 You Violate Rules &amp; Don\u2019t Follow the Guidelines<\/h2>\n<p>Violating rules and not following the social media platforms standards can be an easy way to shut down your ad campaign (or even your page.)<\/p>\n<p>Facebook is very strict and has a lot of policies you must follow.<\/p>\n<p>There are restricted topics like alcohol and dating, targeting options must not discriminate any race or gender, and so much more.<\/p>\n<p>You can see the full list of all <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/policies\/ads\">ad-related guidelines and policies here<\/a><\/u>.<\/p>\n<p>But there is a lot more than meets the eye. There are also specific community best practices and a lot of other things to keep in mind.<\/p>\n<p>These things are also super-dynamic and keep changing all the time.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a beginner, I recommend you enroll in an online course and learn more about the rules, policies, and standards to follow. It will help you make sure you don\u2019t violate any regulations and keep your ads up and going (<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.adamenfroy.com\/best-online-course-platforms\">here are the best online course<\/a><\/u> platforms.)<\/p>\n<p>Never stop learning about the policies; prevent shutting down your campaign and drive better results.<\/p>\n<h2>#9 BONUS TIP: Track Your Success<\/h2>\n<p>Measuring all-important KPIs and staying on top of things is critical to spot errors early on and prevent them as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t need any fancy analytics tool for that. In fact, everything you need is to go to your Facebook Ad account\u2019s dashboard, and you get all the insights there.<\/p>\n<p>You can see your budget, impressions, clicks, engagement, and all other vital metrics.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure to monitor them carefully and take note of any inconsistencies. That way, you can catch any flaws and errors early on and prevent major problems.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook ads can be a great way to <u><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/6-practical-strategies-to-increase-your-online-visibility\/\">increase brand awareness<\/a><\/u>, boost sales, and get more customers.
