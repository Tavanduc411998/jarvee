Hundreds and thousands of dollars are being spent on Influencer Marketing each day. Top brands are hiring the best of the best, solely to market on Instagram.  <\/p>\n<p>What are <strong>you<\/strong> doing with your Instagram marketing? Is your answer to this question somewhere along the lines of \u2018not much\u2019 or \u2018I don\u2019t know what to do\u2019? <\/p>\n<p>If so, worry not.  <\/p>\n<p>Jarvee has compiled a few Instagram tips that many brands are following and have resulted in great success. <\/p>\n<h2> 1. Use A Squeeze Page Link In Your Profile <\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3579 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Lead-magnet.jpg\" alt=\"instagram tips checklist\" width=\"600\" height=\"354\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Lead-magnet.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Lead-magnet-300x177.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/> <\/p>\n<p>Expanding your pool of subscriber emails is the most effective way to reach out to your prospective followers. The first and most obvious strategy for this is the use of a URL in your profile. However, instead of your homepage, we suggest the use of a specific squeeze page. This is the strategy which helped Foundr magazine to grow their brand exponentially on Instagram- one of their biggest social media platforms. <\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/foundr\/\">Foundr<\/a> has been able to muster more than a million followers (1.4 million to be exact) with the help of improvisations like posting inspirational quotes on Instagram. This also attracted many new readers on their website. <\/p>\n<p>Unlike most of the websites, clicking the magazine&#8217;s website does not take users to Foundr\u2019s homepage. Instead, the traffic is directed to a page which offers a free e-book\/guide in exchange for an email.\u00a0As you enter your email, you\u2019ll become a subscriber of Foundr and will receive further follow-ups from them in the future. Foundr&#8217;s strategy for growing their email list provides an exemplary case of the effective use of a squeeze page. <\/p>\n<p>In another prototypical illustration, Jeff Bullas- a famous social media influencer and blogger, has posted several types of pictures and media on his blogs along with his articles and writings. A visit to the website makes it evident that in addition to Jeff Bullas&#8217; own content, the website is also replete with links to several specific squeeze pages, offering free resources in exchange for the users\u2019 email address. <\/p>\n<p>Jeff Bullas\u2019 email list gives him the opportunity of sharing and reaching out with his latest blog posts, special offers, and other promotional activities to a wide range of potentially interested users.<\/p>\n<h2> 2. Wisely Set A Posting Schedule <\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3580 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/posting-schedule.jpg\" alt=\"instagram tips calendar\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/posting-schedule.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/posting-schedule-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Next in importance is the question of the number of times one should post on Instagram and the most suitable time for posting. From the point of view of user-engagement, posting at least one or two <a href=\"https:\/\/stories.buffer.com\/how-often-to-post-to-facebook-twitter-linkedin-and-more-bb2758459162\">posts<\/a> each day is preferable.<\/p>\n<p>Continuing with the example of Foundr, the magazine can be observed as posting 1 quote each day, which is occasionally followed by a post highlighting the updates they make to their magazines every now and then.<\/p>\n<p>CoSchedule conducted a study and analyzed that three posts a day were rather high, whereas a single post a day was on the lower side. According to another study, most of the leading brands were found posting on Instagram one-and-a-half times a day on average.  <\/p>\n<p>For the optimum timings for uploading posts, the first post should be uploaded around 2:00 am, followed by a second post between 8:00 am and 9:00 am. Several studies have established that these are the times when user traffic is greatest and chances of engagement are, therefore, the most favorable. <\/p>\n<p>To make sure you never miss a posting day you need to have the best scheduling tools in your social media marketing toolkit. With <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/\">JARVEE<\/a> you can automate the <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-to-grow-your-instagram-accounts-like-a-pro-with-jarvee\/\">growth of your accounts in just 10 minutes<\/a>. Not only that, but you can <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/cross-promoting-social-media-jarvee\/\">cross-promote your products<\/a> on the most important social channels.<\/p>\n<h2> 3. Sharing Fan Pictures <\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3578 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Go-pro-Fan-pictures.jpg\" alt=\"instagram tips gopro\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Go-pro-Fan-pictures.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Go-pro-Fan-pictures-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The third strategy we advise to use is the sharing of pictures and media content of fans. This was first adopted by GoPro, the camera manufacturing company which also develops its own mobile apps and video-editing software. <\/p>\n<p>We can film ourselves and our loved ones, going snowboarding and kayaking, by easily mounting GoPro\u2019s cameras on our equipment. GoPro\u2019s strategy is to post fans\u2019 pictures and similar content which they feel they\u2019ll have a hard time coming up by themselves. GoPro fans from around the globe are seen filming themselves doing all kinds of activities. Their videos are sent to GoPro who, in turn, upload such content selectively on their social media pages.  <\/p>\n<p>What the company cashes in on is the human nature of enjoying oneself being promoted by brands. As a result, GoPro enjoys thousands of likes and comments on each post that they share with the public.  <\/p>\n<p>Seeing the opportunity, Evernote has also started to follow the footsteps of GoPro. As a Productivity app, Evernote has adopted a new strategy.   They now upload pictures sent by their fans from their workplace. The strategy has earned them a decent enlargement of their followers&#8217; engagement.  <\/p>\n<p>In the end, followers of both GoPro and Evernote now feel a much greater personal connection with the two brands. <\/p>\n<h2> 4. Use More Faces <\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3577 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Beautiful-Woman.jpg\" alt=\"instagram tips beautiful face\" width=\"600\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Beautiful-Woman.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Beautiful-Woman-300x234.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Yet another technique for increasing your followers&#8217; engagement on Instagram is the use of more faces in posts. A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.news.gatech.edu\/2014\/03\/20\/face-it-instagram-pictures-faces-are-more-popular\">study<\/a> by Georgia Tech University reveals a 32% increase in comments and 38% increase in the number of likes on posts which include a face.  <\/p>\n<p>Brands which hire artists, athletes and other renowned personalities post pictures with faces of their respective celebrities. This attracts the fans of these celebrities to like, comment and engage with the brands endorsed by their favorite personalities. In short, posting pictures with more humanoid faces increases engagement. We talk more about picture psychology of Instagram in this <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/instagram-marketing-strategy\/\">post.<\/a> <\/p>\n<h2> 5. Make Your Social Media Profile Similar Among All Platforms. <\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3581 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Social-Media.jpg\" alt=\"instagram tips social media\" width=\"600\" height=\"435\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Social-Media.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/Social-Media-300x218.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Our final tip is to use a single identity for your social media profiles. As a business, it is inevitable for you to have several social media profiles: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram etc. <\/p>\n<p>However,\u00a0 all social media profiles should be consistent with each other. This makes it relatively easier for users to find you.<\/p>\n<p>Entrepreneur.com operates its Instagram page by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/entrepreneur\/\">instagram.com\/entrepreneur<\/a>. It is consistent with every other of its social media profile. All their names are in the format: domain.com\/entrepreneur. In addition to this, the brand has the same logo and a common username on all platforms. <\/p>\n<p>This will increase the chances of a user visiting other social platforms when visiting a different one. <\/p>\n<p>Make sure to follow the aforementioned steps. You&#8217;ll surely witness fruitful results in terms of website traffic and followers on your brand\u2019s Instagram page!\u00a0 <\/p>\n<p>Wondering what tool to use for a squeeze page? There are many tools out there for this purpose, like LeadPages for example. You can search on google to find the ones best suited to you. <\/p>\n<p>We hope you found this article informative and helpful.
