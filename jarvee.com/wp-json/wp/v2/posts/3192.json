The fact of the matter is that this does not affect only people that use automation but everyone though. If you do a google search for the above phrase you&#8217;ll see that most of the people that complain about this are in fact regular users with just one account. These people use their phone to do their Instagram marketing and go through the time consuming process of manually doing everything with the exact outcome as the people using automation.<\/p>\n<p>Why does this happen to both? Because they do too many like actions. Nowadays the high end Instagram automation software is pretty much untraceable, what can be see however are the action each account does. This is what Instagram&#8217;s spam prevention algorithm is primarily based on and this is what will get you in trouble.<\/p>\n<h3>How to find out if you are blocked from liking<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using your account on your phone it&#8217;s pretty easy, you&#8217;ll notice you are not allowed to like anymore and an error message will appear each time you try to do it.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re growing multiple accounts with <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\">Jarvee<\/a> checking each one on your phone would be trickier. In case you missed the message about your like tool in Jarvee&#8217;s Summary tab or you don&#8217;t see any liking happening there although your Like tool is turned on, then you should check Tools section.<\/p>\n<p>Simply go to the Tools section in Jarvee and take a look at the Like column. If you are blocked from liking, you should see a red exclamation mark there and after hovering over it a message about being blocked will pop up.<\/p>\n<p>Like blocks happen for several reasons. Keep reading to find out why and what you can do to avoid them in the future.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Too aggressive with liking \u2013 this happens when you do too many like actions in a short period of time<\/h3>\n<p>As I&#8217;ve already hinted above, one of the most common reasons for getting like blocked is being too aggressive with liking. This can happen not only when you&#8217;re using Instagram automation tools, but also when you&#8217;re liking manually. Instagram limit is somewhere around 60 likes per hour, so you should always have that in mind and keep your likes below this number.<\/p>\n<p>If you use Jarvee to automate your Instagram actions, when setting up the like tool, pay attention to the numbers at the top, next to the START\/STOP button where you can see approximations calculated based on averages from the settings you specified.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/jarvee-calculates-your-liking-averages-per-hour.jpg\" alt=\"jarvee calculates your liking averages per hour\" width=\"604\" height=\"305\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3196\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/jarvee-calculates-your-liking-averages-per-hour.jpg 604w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/jarvee-calculates-your-liking-averages-per-hour-300x151.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/jarvee-calculates-your-liking-averages-per-hour-600x303.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>To lower the chances of getting like blocked you should consider adding night mode for your Instagram account\/s. During this time none of the actions will be executed and your account will look  more natural. Liking posts or doing any other action 24\/7 is obvious automation and the Instagram algorithm can easily spot this. That is why night mode is really important. <\/p>\n<h3>2. Your IP or proxy is blacklisted for liking on Instagram<\/h3>\n<p>Another reason that could lead to like blocks could be your IP or Proxy. If you are regular user that runs one or two Instagram accounts, you probably don&#8217;t use proxies. Even then, if you are too aggressive with your settings, Instagram might temporary block your IP from liking. In this case, if you add a new Instagram account in Jarvee you probably won&#8217;t be able to like Instagram posts. That&#8217;s an obvious sign of IP block.<\/p>\n<p>The solution here is to stop all actions for 24-48 hours or even more if possible and let your accounts and IP cool down since blocks on your real IP are usually just temporary blocks and they disappear in a couple of days.<\/p>\n<p>On the other side, advanced users who run multiple Instagram accounts are forced to use proxies. The problem is, Instagram is fighting against fake engagement lately and they have blocked liking through most proxies, even if you use private ones. Don&#8217;t be confused with word &#8220;private&#8221; here. If your proxy provider sold you private proxy, that doesn&#8217;t mean nobody used it for shady actions (spam) on Instagram before you. It just means that you are the only one using them at this moment. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Solutions that you can try when getting like blocks on proxies<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stop account and rest proxy for 24-48 hours or more and try starting the like tool again, make sure you don&#8217;t use aggressive settings<\/li>\n<li>Ask your proxy provider to change your proxies<\/li>\n<li>Change proxy provider completely \u2013 in this case ask the new provider to give you a proxy for testing for just one day so you can check if the like tool work fine or not.<\/li>\n<li>Get residential proxies. Most residential proxies work for liking on Instagram. The small problem is that they are more expensive than data center proxies. However, if liking posts is part of your Instagram strategy and brings you revenue, the price should not be a problem.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>3. Your Instagram profile&#8217;s trust factor<\/h3>\n<p>Not all Instagram accounts are created equal. Some have higher trust factor than others. This is something that you won&#8217;t be able to check or see directly unfortunately.<\/p>\n<p>Trust score is based on the age of the account, how the account was created, creation IP, bio or link used in your profile and action patterns that account did so far.<\/p>\n<p>Aged accounts have higher trust score and you are able to do more actions with them, however, this doesn&#8217;t necessarily means you will be able to like 100&#8217;s of posts immediately without getting blocked. Even aged accounts need to go through a warming up phase if they haven&#8217;t been used in a while, so, when you add aged account in Jarvee, make sure you start slow and increase the number of daily actions every couple of days.<\/p>\n<p>Some accounts are simply created on bad IP&#8217;s and Instagram blakclisted them. There&#8217;s not much you can do in this case. You will find this type of accounts usually when buying them from unknown sellers on forums, so, pay attention from who are you buying them and read reviews first. Ideally don&#8217;t buy too many at once, sample the product as they say, then when you are sure of the quality go for more.<\/p>\n<p>In some cases, if you get like blocks, it&#8217;s highly likely that happened because you have a \u201eblacklisted\u201c link in your profile. Great example of blacklisted links are CPA offers links. If you use them without a prelanding page or cloaker, your Instagram account could easily get blocked from liking or doing any other actions or even worse, disabled completely. Aside from links, some words could also be blacklisted and even if  you don&#8217;t use any link in your profile, if you use, for example \u201eFree followers\u201c somewhere in your bio, you could get blocked from liking or doing other actions on Instagram.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So, what are the solutions? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Make sure you keep your Instagram profile clean. If you are using Jarvee to automate your Instagram actions, make sure you mix actions so you simulate human behavior. Don&#8217;t use only follow and like tools.<\/p>\n<p>In Jarvee, we have a lot of different tools that will make your account more human-like: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Story Viewer that will view stories for you (bots don&#8217;t do that, right?)<\/li>\n<li>Save Posts tool that normal users (those that don&#8217;t use IG automation) also use<\/li>\n<li>Like comments tool (also used by normal users to show appreciation by liking comments on their own posts) <\/li>\n<li>and many other tools that can help your account look natural.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to post to your Instagram account on daily basis, add night mode for it as mentioned in above and of course, don&#8217;t be aggressive with your settings, take it easy.
