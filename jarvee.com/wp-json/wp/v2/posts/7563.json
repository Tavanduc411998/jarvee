Besides \u201cFleets\u201d conveniently rhyming with \u201cTweets\u201d, the move makes sense for Twitter in the always-raging battle for users\u2019 attention. Though the feature has received backlash and the usual griping from the platform\u2019s users, it seems the feature is here to stay. <\/p>\n<p>So, what exactly does it mean for those that earn an income or have a following on Twitter? Well, for starters, it means that Twitter is still actively competing for attention and market share when it comes to screen time. Fleets offer a feature that almost every social media platform already has, including Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook. For earners, it foremost means that your engagement will likely increase. <\/p>\n<p>The mission of Fleets is to allow users to interact with those they follow immediately when they open the app. Strategically located at the top of the app, you\u2019re no longer taking a gamble as to whether your followers see your content on their timeline on any given day. Without Fleets, you are competing with hundreds of other tweets each second. Putting out a Fleet allows you to grab their full attention, even if it is only for a few seconds. <\/p>\n<p>Though there have been some complaints about the feature, it figures to really help our creators grow their presence on the platform and make sure that their followers are more engaged from the moment that they open the app. Frequently uploading Fleets will ensure you continue to remain at the forefront of their mind. Essentially, it allows creators to force their way to the top of the timeline&#8211;as long as they are committed to producing quality, Fleet-worthy content. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you\u2019ve been keeping up-to-date with the latest in pop culture and social media, then you may have heard of the new feature that has been launched on Twitter&#8211;Fleets.
