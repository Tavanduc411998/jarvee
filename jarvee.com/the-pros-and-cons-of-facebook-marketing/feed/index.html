					<description><![CDATA[What I like the most about Facebook is under number #2. With Facebook marketing you can share either short messages and links or long lengths of information with your audience. On other social networks your posts are a bit limited since you have to adjust that social platform, but on Facebook, you have more freedom to create the type of content you want.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Facebook is indeed the biggest and most present social media out there. If we add Instagram to it, like the other side of Facebook corporation coin, then we have two biggest platforms in universe. All we need is good content, a little bit money to invest in ads and here we go.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Honestly I&#039;m slowly giving up on facebook marketing. I get so much more ROI on other social network than on facebook. But that it&#039;s fine, I guess that my niche is more interested in other social platforms.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Facebook also has a weird habit of disapproving highly converting ads. My Facebook pages have been banned twice with no explanation whatsoever.

I didn&#039;t do anything against their TOS yet I still faced a ban. When asked why? they ignore straight away. 

The counter to this is to create another Facebook page, but the downfall is that in a way you&#039;re starting a new brand image on Facebook and creating everything from scratch..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[#2 is beneficial from a consumers standpoint but the thing is, competitive niches will result in some brands dealing in dirty business. 

Newcomers in the said niche can see a lot of negative marketing on their brands&#039; page by mass fake accounts. Contacting Facebook about it is a very weak way to counter that hence you&#039;re left with a lot of dirt to wash off of your brand!]]></description>
