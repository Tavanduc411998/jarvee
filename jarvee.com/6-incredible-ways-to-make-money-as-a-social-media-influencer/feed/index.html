					<description><![CDATA[Hi Henry, 

Thanks for sharing! Most important thing is to gather audience that will like your personality and fell like they know you and understand you. This is a long way, but once you have this kind of audience, they will love everything you share, promote, suggest or create. We have so many famous influencers that will manage to sell everything just because their followers are big fans.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, who has not tried, does not know how difficult it is to become influencer. You have to dedicate your life to it, put everything else to side and give 1000%. Sometimes it&#039;s just a pure luck, but in 99% cases it&#039;s a hard work. The main thing is to, somehow, separate your private life from influencer life, it&#039;s very hard to accomplish.]]></description>
