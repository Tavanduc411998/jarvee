					<description><![CDATA[Hello Adam!

I had some of them somewhere in mind as possible ideas, but it&#039;s good to have all these in one place and to start using them one by one. So far I started with Jarvee free trial and I think this is a keeper. It will save me so much time.

I will use the time that I save with Jarvee to create better content for my posts, because there is a lot of space for improvement!But usually I have strict  deadlines and then I release it even if I&#039;m not completely happy with the outcome. Thanks you guys for sharing these with us.]]></description>
