					<description><![CDATA[What about people who beg for followers saying they follow back, but then they go back &#038; delete following you? I hate that, it&#039;s so cringe. I don&#039;t like to be petty but in this case, when someone unfollows me, I unfollow them back. In my case, thats the only people who unfollow me so far.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The most important thing is to be interesting, find the niche and talk about happy things, not sad ones, exclude politics and that kind of stuff. Don&#039;t talk about yourself at all, it&#039;s not necessary :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, if you decide to use automation for your social network, this can be very beneficial only if you know how to properly use it. We use it and pay attention to still keep human touch and to properly target those that will be interested to get some information from us.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You should always keep in mind who your target audience is. If you forget about that and start sharing content that will not be part of their interest or that will be completely different from what they expect from you to post, it won&#039;t be unusual if they unfollow you. This can be said for both personal and business profiles.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is a really good info about twitter! I love your list.
Will probably apply it to my Twitter Marketing strategies other users use too much hate on their twitter and rant on them which is not doing any good]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey Adam,

This is another case of mistaking quality for quantity. A lot of people usually think that the more noise they make on social media, the more their followers will like and value them, not knowing that it actually turns people off. 

I couldn&#039;t have agreed more with your points here. I&#039;ve also unfollowed a lot of people because of the same reasons you outlined here, and I wish more people will see this post so they can be careful of what they post on social media.

Thanks for sharing.]]></description>
