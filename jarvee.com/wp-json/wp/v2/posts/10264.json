It\u2019s only been ten years, but it seems like ages ago because of how rapidly technology evolves nowadays. This evolution affects not only our lifestyles and mindsets but also the career paths we choose. And now, in 2021, the choice is so much wider.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s rewind. We\u2019re once again in 2011\u2026 Instagram has just emerged, and no one knows what to do with it yet. AI algorithms have just been introduced to social media, so it\u2019s still hard to tell how they will affect the digital marketing industry. Coursera and edX are still not around. All in all, things are different.<\/p>\n<p>But the world as it is today presents plenty of business opportunities for everyone. Even students can easily create a tech startup right from their dorm rooms! To make time for that, they can avail the services of an \u200b\u200b<a href=\"https:\/\/essayhub.com\/\">essay helper from EssayHub<\/a> and rest assured their assignments will be taken care of. Today, it only takes a few mouse clicks to arrange.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, new business opportunities have emerged that have not been around ten years ago. Some of them are particularly attractive to students.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for some ideas, here they are. You can be a:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>social media influencer;<\/li>\n<li>online courses creator;<\/li>\n<li>online courses producer;<\/li>\n<li>cryptocurrency miner;<\/li>\n<li>AI startup owner.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s talk about each one in detail.<\/p>\n<h3>Social Media Influencer<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10269\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/social-media-influencer.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/social-media-influencer.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/social-media-influencer-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/social-media-influencer-600x338.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Some may not consider social media influencers real business people but we advise that you think deeper. On the surface, an influencer is more of an entertainer who produces fun content for people to like and share \u2013 but how does it all work?<\/p>\n<p>When the influencer culture gained momentum at the beginning of the 2010s, few people really understood the behind-the-scenes process. Now we know that most influencers are in fact businesspeople with a staff of employees working for them \u2013 producing, editing, publishing, and curating content, looking for ad deals, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, when you\u2019re just starting out, you can do everything on your own with a little help from your friends and EssayService \u2013 an online writing service to handle your coursework. Being a social media influencer is difficult, you know\u2026 But even in the worst-case scenario (if you don\u2019t make it big), you\u2019ll at least have some fun.<\/p>\n<h3>Online Courses Creator<\/h3>\n<p>Online educational courses have been on the rise since at least 2012, but the pandemic has made them a really big deal. Having been left without opportunities to spend time offline, people have turned to self-development in an attempt to stay relevant amidst the disruption of the job market. They only had one choice: to study online.<\/p>\n<p>Some were choosing big platforms like Coursera, edX, Udemy, and the like. But others chose to buy courses from social media experts and influencers instead. So, everyone with at least some knowledge in any field started <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/top-10-online-training-software-to-create-sell-online-courses\/\">making online courses<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The interesting thing is, the trend has not died out \u2013\u00a0even though the pandemic restrictions have been lifted in most countries. People continue buying courses, and you can fit in easily if you have the expertise, persistence, and spare time. Later on, you can hire staff and start your own online school!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10268\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Online-Courses-School-Producer.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Online-Courses-School-Producer.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Online-Courses-School-Producer-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Online-Courses-School-Producer-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Online Courses\/School Producer<\/h3>\n<p>In case you don\u2019t see yourself as a course creator, you can still try to make use of the trend by becoming an online courses or school producer. The idea is, many experts are good at whatever they do for a living, so they can write a decent course. Still, most of them cannot record, market, and sell it without outside help.<\/p>\n<p>A producer takes care of all those seemingly small things that help create and sell a course: content and advertising plans for the expert\u2019s blog, hiring writers, photographers, and videographers, making schedules, etc.<\/p>\n<p>All that may sound like typical work-for-hire, right? But the best thing is, you can work with more experts than one at a time. After that, you can hire assistants, assemble a team and even create your own course for producers. Now, that\u2019s more like a business!<\/p>\n<h3>Cryptocurrency Miner<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10267\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Cryptocurrency-Miner.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Cryptocurrency-Miner.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Cryptocurrency-Miner-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Cryptocurrency-Miner-600x399.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Though Bitcoin, the first <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/c\/cryptocurrency.asp\">cryptocurrency<\/a>, had emerged as far back as 2009, mining was more of a hobby back then. Today, when one Bitcoin costs over 50 thousand dollars, the stakes have rocketed. Now, cryptocurrency mining is a serious \u2013 and costly \u2013 business.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, in 2018, a story appeared in the news about students who were mining cryptocurrency in their dorm rooms. They\u2019d been doing that for two years by the time the story surfaced, one of the students admitted. And some similar stories could be traced even further back.<\/p>\n<p>However, things have gotten more complicated since then. In 2021, one needs insanely powerful equipment which costs a hefty sum \u2013 not to count other costs. So, few students can afford to mine nowadays \u2013 but those who risk it may get considerable profit. If \u201cthe cryptocurrency bubble\u201d doesn\u2019t burst anytime soon, that is.<\/p>\n<h3>AI Startup Owner<\/h3>\n<p>Artificial intelligence has been around for quite a while now \u2013 actually, the term was coined more than half a century ago. Today, you don\u2019t have to be as smart as Tony Stark (and probably don\u2019t even have to graduate from MIT) to create an AI startup.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, we\u2019re not talking about something as advanced as those machines from the movies, but tech students are already <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ashleystahl\/2021\/03\/10\/how-ai-will-impact-the-future-of-work-and-life\/\">using AI to make existing jobs easier<\/a>. You can choose any area you like: marketing, delivery services, healthcare, anything. AI can be useful practically everywhere.<\/p>\n<p>The only problem here is, you have to be both a tech specialist and a businessperson, or how would you market and sell your product otherwise? There are very few people who combine these qualities, so you might need a partner to promote your idea.<\/p>\n<h3>Wrapping Up<\/h3>\n<p>Student years are perfect for trying one\u2019s hand at entrepreneurship, and today, there are more business opportunities for students than ever. You can start a company from your dorm room, between doing homework and having a cup of coffee \u2013 all thanks to the internet and the evolution of technology.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we\u2019ve listed a few business opportunities that have not been there ten years ago. But there are more \u2013 and they are always continuing to emerge. Don\u2019t miss your chance!<\/p>\n<h3>About the Author<\/h3>\n<p>Mary Schroeder is an experienced blog writer who explores the trends in the world of technology and how they influence business, society, and simply our everyday lives.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you remember how things were back in 2011?
