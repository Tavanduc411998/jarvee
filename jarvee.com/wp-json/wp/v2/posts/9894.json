They are simple, easy to plan, and cost-effective. Because of that, they have become increasingly popular in recent years.<\/p>\n<p>What is a ransom hack, though? In short, a ransom hack is a cyberattack that uses regulations put in place by the European Union (GDPR &#8211; General Data Protection Regulation) to extort money from business owners. If you are attacked in such a way, the hackers will threaten to release the sensitive information belonging to your customers unless you pay a specific amount of money. If you fail to do that, the hackers will release the information, which is likely to get any <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bulletproof.co.uk\/gdpr\">GDPR compliance company<\/a><\/u> fined by the European Union.<\/p>\n<p>Would you like to know how to protect your business from ransomware? If so, this article is for you! Below, you will find a list of cybersecurity tips that you can use to keep yourself safe, including backing up your most important data on a daily basis, avoiding suspicious emails and links, and monitoring your network for mistrustful activity. Check it out!<\/p>\n<h3>Back Up Your Data<\/h3>\n<p>If you want to protect your business from a ransom hack, the first thing that you need to do is <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.creativebloq.com\/advice\/back-up-data\">back up your data<\/a><\/u>. You can do this yourself with a cloud storage system like Google Drive, Dropbox, and iCloud. Alternatively, you can turn to one of the many online backup services. This way, if one of your devices gets hacked, the attack will be contained, and the hackers will not have access to every one of your files.<\/p>\n<h3>Avoid Suspicious Emails and Links<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9896\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Avoid-Suspicious-Emails-and-Links.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Avoid-Suspicious-Emails-and-Links.png 602w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Avoid-Suspicious-Emails-and-Links-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Avoid-Suspicious-Emails-and-Links-600x338.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In order to protect your business from ransomware, you should avoid clicking on questionable links and opening attachments of <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncsc.gov.uk\/guidance\/suspicious-email-actions\">suspicious emails<\/a><\/u>. Hackers might hide malicious links inside attachments and within email messages. These links might lead you to malware-infected websites, which may steal your data.<\/p>\n<p>To protect yourself from these attacks, you should never open attachments that come from sources you do not know. In addition, avoid clicking on links coming from emails that seem suspicious in any way. Instead, double-check if the email address that sended you the message is the same as the email address of a company you know or trust.<\/p>\n<h3>Monitor Your Network<\/h3>\n<p>Next, you must monitor your network for questionable activity. You can do this by installing a cybersecurity program on your computer. They are designed to detect suspicious activity on networks and alert you to take steps to prevent attacks from happening. Install one on all your devices and run regular scans to make sure that everything is going smoothly.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, you may want to invest in security cameras to keep an eye on people coming in and out of your business. This will help prevent in-person social engineering attacks, which are becoming increasingly common among hackers.<\/p>\n<h3>Lock Down Your Router<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9897\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Lock-Down-Your-Router.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"316\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Lock-Down-Your-Router.png 602w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Lock-Down-Your-Router-300x157.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Lock-Down-Your-Router-600x315.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you want to protect your business from a ransomware hack or virus, you need to lock down your router. You can use <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lifewire.com\/what-is-wpa2-818352\">WPA2 encryption<\/a><\/u> to make sure that only authorized devices can connect to it. This can significantly reduce the risk of remote attacks. You should also change the default password on your router and make sure that it&#8217;s as secure as possible.<\/p>\n<h3>Know When to Call Professionals<\/h3>\n<p>If you are in a situation where you need to get rid of ransomware, the best thing that you can do is call a <u><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-to-overcome-cyber-security-risks-in-digital-marketing\/\">cybersecurity<\/a><\/u> company. You can find plenty of such companies online, and they will be able to help you deal with your troubles without causing long-term damage to your business. Keep in mind that you will have to pay for their services, but if you choose the right company, it will definitely be worth the money.<\/p>\n<h3>Update Your Security Settings<\/h3>\n<p>The next thing you must do to protect your <u><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/the-top-security-threats-that-threaten-your-online-business-right-now\/\">business<\/a><\/u> against ransom hacks is update your security settings. Hackers may try to hack into your network using outdated security settings, so you must ensure that yours are up-to-date. On top of that, you should change the default username and password on each of your devices and computers, as it might give hackers easy access to your data. Do not forget to update your passwords regularly, too!<\/p>\n<h3>Use a Firewall<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9898\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Use-a-Firewall.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Use-a-Firewall.png 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Use-a-Firewall-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Use-a-Firewall-600x399.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It is safe to say that a firewall is an excellent tool for protecting your business against ransomware, as it prevents hackers from accessing your network. To take advantage of its benefits, install one on each of your devices and computers and update it on a regular basis so that it can detect any suspicious activity on your network and alert you immediately. Keep in mind that there are many firewalls out there, so you will need to choose one that is easy to use and reliable!<\/p>\n<h3>Check Your Employees<\/h3>\n<p>You need to check your potential employees&#8217; <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thebalancecareers.com\/background-checks-1918967\">backgrounds<\/a><\/u> before hiring them. You never know if they have been involved in any cyberattacks in the past. If they have, they might bring malware into your business. This could include ransomware and other malware types designed to steal sensitive information from businesses like yours. By checking their records first, you will be able to find out if they have been involved in cyberattacks and protect your business from one!<\/p>\n<h3>In Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>To sum up, ransomware is a deadly threat to businesses worldwide. For this reason, it is crucial that you act and take the recommended actions mentioned in this article. From backing up your data to updating your security settings \u2014 all of them can help you keep your company up and running for many years to come.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to avoid being attacked by ransomware and ensure that your business is safe from hackers who might try to extort money from you by using GDPR, do not underestimate the value of cybersecurity. Whether we like it or not, it is an indispensable part of owning a business in today&#8217;s day and age. As such, you should invest in the best cybersecurity measures on the market.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Author<\/h3>\n<p>Przemys\u0142aw Puternicki is the author of numerous articles on cybersecurity.
