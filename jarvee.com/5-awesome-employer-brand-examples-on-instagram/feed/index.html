Hey! Thanks for your comment!

I agree with Elaina here. If such content is well-curated and there is a clear intent behind each picture, there&#039;s no harm in posting it on your company&#039;s social media. Besides, involving your employees in this entire process brings you closer to them for sure :)]]></description>
