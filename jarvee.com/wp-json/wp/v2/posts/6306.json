A study reveals that over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/203513\/usage-trands-of-social-media-platforms-in-marketing\/\">90% of US companies<\/a> are using social networks for marketing purposes, so you\u2019ll definitely have to fight niche competitors on this battlefield, too.<\/p>\n<p>The main objective of social media campaigns is to drive user engagement as it\u2019s the only way to consistently build relationships and grow brand loyalty. You can do it using many tools and techniques, but we will show you the 10 most productive social media engagement hacks to boost your business.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Optimize Your Accounts Properly<\/h2>\n<p>A social media user is not eager to interact with business accounts that don\u2019t look highly professional and trustworthy. Therefore, the first task is to optimize your accounts properly and give them a truly professional look. Pay attention to these details:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Upload a high-quality profile picture, preferably a company logo<\/li>\n<li>Write a brief profile description with all the basic information about your business<\/li>\n<li>Add a link to your website or landing page (keep in mind that this is the only linking opportunity on Instagram)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>2.\u00a0Create Audience-Focused Content<\/h2>\n<p>Way too many business owners and their <a href=\"https:\/\/cake.hr\/\">HR software<\/a> believe that social networks are a channel of direct promotion, but they are wrong. On the contrary, social media users expect you to create audience-focused content and come up with topics that really matter to everyday consumers.<\/p>\n<p>Experience taught us that the best solution is to follow the 80\/20 content creation principle. In this case, 80% of posts are audience-centric, while only 20% of posts are directly related to your products or services. Such a content design plan allows you to smoothly balance between entertaining and promo messages.<\/p>\n<h2>3.\u00a0Make a Versatile Content Strategy<\/h2>\n<p>Top-level marketers make versatile content strategies because they know that only one type of social posts won\u2019t make a difference in the long run. Luckily enough, you\u2019ve got plenty of options to play with here. Here is the list of popular content formats you can publish on social platforms:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Textual posts<\/li>\n<li>Images and illustrations<\/li>\n<li>GIFs, memes, and animations<\/li>\n<li>Videos and live stream<\/li>\n<li>Charts, graphs, and tables<\/li>\n<li>Audio content<\/li>\n<li>Case studies and testimonials<\/li>\n<li>Online reviews<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>4.\u00a0Let the Content Suit the Network<\/h2>\n<p>Another thing you should keep in mind is that every social media platform is different and unique. In other words, you should let the content suit a given network instead of just publishing the same post on across multiple channels.<\/p>\n<p>For example, LinkedIn users expect to read long-form articles with insightful details and data-driven conclusions. On the other hand, Instagram is all about attractive images and videos. The bottom line is that you have to acknowledge the peculiarities of each platform and craft engaging content accordingly.<\/p>\n<h2>5.\u00a0Take Advantage of Trendy Topics<\/h2>\n<p>Trends come and go, but there is always a short interval when it seems like everyone is talking about the hottest talk of the town. You should take advantage of trendy topics because it guarantees free publicity.<\/p>\n<p>All it takes is to find a meaningful correlation between your business and a given trend. Our advice is to use a platform like <a href=\"https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/\">Google Trends<\/a> to receive alerts about interesting people or topics. It will help you to stay in touch with the latest stories and design the corresponding content.<\/p>\n<h2>6.\u00a0Let Your Personality Shine<\/h2>\n<p>The fact that you are running a business account does not mean you should not showcase brand personality. As a matter of fact, social networks are exactly where you should let your personality shine and win over the followers\u2019 attention.<\/p>\n<p>What does it mean in practice? The idea is to act with a slight dose of humor, extravagance, attitude, and irony whenever possible. Although you need to keep things professional, it is also important to personalize activities if you want the audience to engage with your content.<\/p>\n<h2>7.\u00a0Use Emojis<\/h2>\n<p>Do you know that 25% of tweets with emojis earn a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.martechadvisor.com\/articles\/content-experience\/emoji-marketing-in-2020\/\">higher engagement<\/a>, while nearly 60% of Facebook posts with emojis get more likes? Emojis are simple visual details but they can do miracles for your business engagement-wise.<\/p>\n<p>The brain processes visual information much quicker than plain text, which means that social media fans are likely to notice emoji-powered posts first. The only thing that really matters is to select them cleverly and use emojis that perfectly suit your posts.<\/p>\n<h2>8.\u00a0Use the Best Online Tools for Engagement<\/h2>\n<p>Social media marketing is complex, but you don\u2019t have to do it single-handedly. There are all sorts of interesting tools you should check out, with some of them being extremely useful for building user engagement. Our favorite platforms include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canva.com\/\">Canva<\/a> makes it easy to design beautiful visual content<\/li>\n<li>Read <a href=\"https:\/\/awriter.org\/college-paper-org-review\/\">college paper.org reviews<\/a> to find the best content writing service<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/buffer.com\/\">Buffer Reply<\/a> for brand storytelling<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/buzzsumo.com\/\">BuzzSumo<\/a> for content management and influencer marketing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>9. Promote UGC<\/h2>\n<p>If you run out of ideas, there is an easy way out \u2013 simply invite your fans to create user-generated content (UGC). This tactic guarantees to boost engagement and also serves as a genuine loyalty driver.<\/p>\n<p>Namely, a typical user feels acknowledged when brands like, share, or comment on his\/her posts. You should keep that in mind and encourage people to craft brand-related posts. Social media contests are also a valuable idea, so don\u2019t hesitate to organize such events periodically.<\/p>\n<h2>10. Ask Questions<\/h2>\n<p>The last tip on our list goes without saying, but it\u2019s so simple that lots of social media marketers tend to forget or neglect it. The logic is clear \u2013 you can ask a question in your post and encourage fans to write creative answers. All the top-performing businesses are doing it and there\u2019s no reason for you to skip this tactic.<\/p>\n<p>And if you are willing to take the extra step, we suggest asking questions during live video sessions. That way, you can maximize engagement and increase watch times as people will wait patiently to hear answers to their questions.<\/p>\n<h2>Up to You<\/h2>\n<p>Social media marketing can earn you tons of new leads, but you have to play the game cleverly and inspire the audience to react to your content.
