There are a vast number of individuals who prefer social media to get updated with the latest breaking news and updates. And when it comes to news, Twitter is much ahead of any other social media<\/p>\n<p>Twitter is already famous for breaking news, trendings news and viral trends of all the fields, i.e. politics, business, entertainment, sports, etc. With that, politicians, journalists, and business tycoons used this platform to burst big news related to their business or any kind of law before it went into mainstream media.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use it as your mouthpiece to post updates and spread news about the services or products you offer. Keep your eyes on what\u2019s trending in your industry and field of work. Then plan your strategies according to them.<\/p>\n<h3>#3 Minimum Words With Maximum Impact<\/h3>\n<p>The extraordinary thing about Twitter is its policy of limit in characters, that is, 280 characters which was limited to 140 characters earlier. The limited number of characters forces users to post the information shortly and precisely.<\/p>\n<p>In this modern world, most people don\u2019t have enough time to read a long post, and everyone wants to get enough information in the quickest way possible. That\u2019s why Twitter is the choice of the site that people prefer.<\/p>\n<p>This causes the user to post more image and video oriented content on the platform. So the short form of content is still popular, and it will be again in the trend in 2021.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure to put the valuable character in your tweet, as you only have 280 characters to impress the audience with your story.<\/p>\n<h3>#4 Use of Memes<\/h3>\n<p>Memes are the funniest way to respond to any situation, and it is pretty popular on Twitter. Memes can also be used as a sarcastic response to any tweet. Famous people also use memes rather than words.<\/p>\n<p>And such types of <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/5-most-engaging-types-of-twitter-posts\">tweets have higher engagement<\/a> and higher reach compared to tweets with words or data.<\/p>\n<p>Along with that, big brands always use funny ways of advertising to spread awareness towards their brand. This is also known as meme marketing, where you provide any information to the user with entertainment.<\/p>\n<h3>#5 Sharing of Blog Post<\/h3>\n<p>The goal of sharing your blog post link on social media platforms is always to get a good amount of traffic. But it is not limited to that in Twitter. There are other benefits also. Now, Twitter has provided an in-house browser to access the links of blogs and sites.<\/p>\n<p>It will be another trend in 2021 as it encourages readers to open the link, which simply increases the traffic of the blogs. Along with that, this boosted the networking in the particular niche led by an extended audience.<\/p>\n<p>Sharing of one excerpt from the article in the tweet is also getting popular these days. It brings readers from Twitter to your blog post quite effectively.<\/p>\n<h3>#6 Use of Infographics<\/h3>\n<p>A picture can tell stories without using a word. It becomes more significant for a platform like Twitter, where we only have a limit of 280 characters. Infographics are becoming widely popular in recent years.<\/p>\n<p>Infographics tweets get higher engagement than a tweet filled with words. And there wouldn\u2019t be any need to use multiple threads to share longer tweets as it can be shortened using infographics.<\/p>\n<p>It is a well-known trend by businesses, and they are using it thoroughly in their <a href=\"https:\/\/neilpatel.com\/blog\/startup-marketing-strategies\/\">marketing strategies<\/a>. So if you are using pictures and infographics only on Instagram, then this is the time to use it on Twitter as well.<\/p>\n<h3>#7 Audio Format Tweets<\/h3>\n<p>Last but not least, audio format content. This would be a game-changer feature on Twitter. Now, you can use your voice as a tweet. Yes, in 2020, Twitter has introduced a feature where you can post audio tweets.<\/p>\n<p>The feature of audio tweets is well accepted by podcasters and voice artists. However, it is available only on the iOS platform now, but Twitter is working on launching this feature on Android soon.<\/p>\n<p>Hence, Audio tweets will be in the trend of 2021, and you should consider it on your marketing goals.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Twitter is the platform where a tweet goes viral and popular with hashtags. It is the platform where you can get important updates regarding many fields, and you can tweet information and updates about your businesses, services or product.<\/p>\n<p>However, recently Nigeria banned Twitter because of their policy conflict, and the same thing is happening in a few more countries. However, still, Twitter has enough potential that you can use for your business. So, check these trends and create your master plan. With that, keep an eye on running hashtags that are also an excellent way to grab people\u2019s attention towards your brand.<\/p>\n<h2>Author&#8217;s Bio<\/h2>\n<p>Harikrishna Kundariya, a marketer, developer, IoT, ChatBot &amp; Blockchain savvy, designer, co-founder, Director of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.esparkinfo.com\/\">eSparkBiz\u00a0 Technologies<\/a>.
