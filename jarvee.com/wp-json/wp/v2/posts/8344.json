Better yet, it will motivate the users to take action as you prefer.<\/p>\n<p>However, this is only possible if you have the ad copy down to perfection. And this means you take into consideration the big picture: CTA, image, video, and <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/facebook-ads-and-chatbot-copywriting-tips\/\">ad copy<\/a>, and make sure all blend within each other to give out your core message.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, marketers are often stumped when it comes to Facebook Ads, and we are not surprised as there is much to take into consideration. But with the right tools and strategies, the process does become a lot easier and efficient.<\/p>\n<p>And this is where we come in!<\/p>\n<p>To help you create the best Facebook ad images, we have curated this guide to tell you what works and what doesn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<h2>Use Relevant, High-Quality Images<\/h2>\n<p>When you are creating image ads, the last thing you want is your ad image to appear out of context. Or something out of the blue that would confuse the viewers. You also don\u2019t want to appear unprofessional by using low-quality or blurry images for your ads.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, there are lots of resources available every day and finding a cheap stock photo is not difficult if you are unable to craft original images.<\/p>\n<p>However, the most important thing you need to remember when taking images from the internet is to look at the licenses associated with them. Don\u2019t pull images off from Google as they are not allowed for commercial use. Instead, look at reputable stock photo sites that give permission for commercial use and modification as you require for your Facebook ads.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8349 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/contrasting-and-complimenting-colors.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"509\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/contrasting-and-complimenting-colors.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/contrasting-and-complimenting-colors-300x191.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/contrasting-and-complimenting-colors-768x489.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/contrasting-and-complimenting-colors-600x382.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Use Contrasting and Complimenting Colors<\/h2>\n<p>Colors are essential when it comes to Facebook ads. They make sure your ad stands out and attracts the attention of the Facebook users who are swiping their newsfeed. One of the easiest ways to do this is by choosing colors that are less likely to blend in with the existing color palette of Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>This means that since Facebook&#8217;s color scheme is mostly blue and white, we should avoid these colors altogether and instead go for bright and vivid colors that make your ad pop.<br \/>\nSome businesses also have a set color scheme that is according to their branding guidelines. Using the same will keep your brand message consistent across all mediums and help your followers immediately resonate.<\/p>\n<p>However, if you don&#8217;t have a set color guideline to work with, choose colors based on people&#8217;s psychology and the adjectives they associate with each one of them. For example, the color red is often linked with the youth and evokes excitement amongst the viewer. On the other hand, blue is the color of trust and illustrates reliability and strength.<br \/>\nBefore choosing your ad colors, educate yourself on color psychology. Look at the Facebook ads of popular brands and see the emotions their color palette evoke in you.<\/p>\n<h2>Showcase your Product<\/h2>\n<p>If you an eCommerce retailer, showcase your original products in your ads \u2013 rather than using a generic picture. You can also promote multiple products by using Facebook\u2019s Carousel ad format that lets you add up to 10 product photos for a single ad.<\/p>\n<p>This will not only attract attention to your product but also enhance conversion rate as the viewers can directly shop from the ad itself. They are also interactive and most social media users enjoy swiping the carousel to see the rest of your product lineup.<\/p>\n<h2>Add Icons and Illustrations<\/h2>\n<p>When product photography is not an option, use illustrations, logos, and vectors for your Facebook ads to get your point across. They are quirky, eye catching, and sometimes more relatable to the audience. In fact, some experts say that they perform better than generic stock images.<\/p>\n<p>Creating graphics is easy with tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canva.com\/\">Canva<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.photoshop.com\/\">Photoshop<\/a>. You can also purchase vector images from stock photograph sites if creating a customized one is not your piece of cake.<\/p>\n<h2>Go Light on the Text<\/h2>\n<p>According to Facebook, ads with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/980593475366490?id=1240182842783684\">20% text and 80% image perform better with the viewers<\/a>. This means your image should do the talking, rather than your text. However, if you do need to add some short message, make it clear and to the point. Make sure it doesn\u2019t get in the way of your image to confuse or overwhelm the reader.<\/p>\n<p>You will also be surprised to see many Facebook ads images have nothing to do with the image it displays. This disconnects the readers from what they are seeing and what they are reading so make sure your message is consistent with the image and vice versa.<\/p>\n<h2>Create a Buyer\u2019s Persona<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook allows <a href=\"https:\/\/enginescout.com.au\/facebook-ad-targeting\/\">detailed targeting of ads<\/a> so make sure you have a buyer\u2019s persona ready. Personas for the ad images will help you understand who you are trying to reach and what is the best method to target them effectively.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that a one-size-fits-all approach doesn\u2019t exist in Facebook advertising. Custom target calls for a customized selection of images.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8348 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/testing-fb-ads.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/testing-fb-ads.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/testing-fb-ads-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/testing-fb-ads-768x513.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/testing-fb-ads-600x401.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Test Each Ad<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to Facebook ads \u2013 never assume! Instead, test everything to ensure your ads give out the most stable results. Even if you have managed to get the conversions rolling, keep on testing different layouts and placements because the consumer\u2019s behavior changes with time and you don\u2019t want them to get bored with your efforts.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, experts suggest that over time you create a new ad campaign, test out four versions of the ad to find out what type of ad images resonate better with the audience. It will also help you get a clear idea about budgeting and ad frequencies to ensure you get the maximum results.<\/p>\n<h2>Final Words<\/h2>\n<p>These were just some of the tips to get you started on Facebook ads images. As you can see, there are multiple ways to <a href=\"https:\/\/nealschaffer.com\/facebook-ads-roi\/\">enhance Facebook\u2019s ad ROI<\/a>, and sometimes using the traditional practices won\u2019t work to give you the results you require.<\/p>\n<p>Try these tips and let us know how they work for you!
