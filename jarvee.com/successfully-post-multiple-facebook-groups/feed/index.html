Looks like FB is limiting your reach. It might be cause you posted too often. I&#039;d suggest you to stop posting for 48 hours and then start again but with slower intensity.]]></description>

Well, the suggestions above should help. Everything FB does is automated, they don&#039;t really care if you&#039;re spamming to get money yourself or want to help someone else like in your case so you have to take it slow and not appear to be spamming and they will let you do it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Thank you for the helpful information. We are a 501c3 Rescue saving homeless animals all over USA: Basically, we just copy and paste information to Groups or paste information to posts.
We just offer information on available Rescues, Shelters etc People really have no idea where to find pets. There is no profit for us. Of course I have been trying n Facebook jail for posting to much.

Do you have any suggestions? Thanks in advance]]></description>
