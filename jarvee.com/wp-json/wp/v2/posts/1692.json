But that does not mean your actions go unnoticed.\u00a0 Every bit of information you post and share is recorded somewhere in the depths of this virtual world.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, awareness of \u201cwhat to do\u201d is equally important as knowing \u201cwhat not to do\u201d.\u00a0 This is what most marketers fail to see.\u00a0\u00a0 It does not take a lot to hit the bottom; one blunder can ignite a major fiasco that can forever ruin your online presence.<\/p>\n<h3>What are the most common social media marketing mistakes?<\/h3>\n<p>Here is a list of the common social media marketing mistakes that more and more online marketers are guilty of and how it can be avoided.<\/p>\n<h2>Having Zero Game Plan<\/h2>\n<p>Since creating a social media account is quite easy, many businesses and brands alike just hastily jumped in and started their online marketing without any strategy at all.\u00a0 While it is not a real world, social media is far from being a fairytale where everything seems to magically fall into place.\u00a0 There is no fairy godmother that will dress you up or a genie that will grant your wishes.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-1698 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/social-media-marketing-plan.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"530\" height=\"353\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/social-media-marketing-plan.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/social-media-marketing-plan-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/social-media-marketing-plan-600x399.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 530px) 100vw, 530px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In whatever endeavor you undertake, the most important thing you ought to create is a plan. If you have a team, be sure to brainstorm and jot down each member\u2019s thoughts.\u00a0 It can be chaotic with many heads involved so you will need to lay out your goals and carefully weigh in all the suggestions and ideas.\u00a0 Make sure everybody is in tune so you can come up with the perfect yet doable strategy for your social media marketing campaign.<\/p>\n<h2>Creating Multiple Social Media Accounts<\/h2>\n<p>The more the merrier spells disaster in social media.\u00a0 While it is tempting to create an account for each of the social media networks out there, it will be smarter to center on the ones where your business and brand can flourish.\u00a0 Know where your target audience is most likely to hang out, connect and socialize there.<\/p>\n<h2>Being Very Corporate<\/h2>\n<p>Your social media account represents your company, business or brand but there is no need to be seriously uptight about it.\u00a0 Let us put it this way, if you were in a non-formal gathering, most folks would come dressed down, wearing their most comfortable clothes and just chilling out.\u00a0 If you approach them garbed in a suit and tie, they would probably exchange a few words with you but they would not engage in a conversation.<\/p>\n<p>Though using your company logo is the most fitting profile picture, find other ways to incorporate your logo into the profile image or cover photo of the account.\u00a0\u00a0 You can choose to use the image of your company, business or brand mascot or endorser instead.<\/p>\n<p>Another thing, be sure to address the person by his name or mention his account when replying to a comment or message to give it that human touch.<\/p>\n<h2>Slow To Response<\/h2>\n<p>Despite having an inbound customer service, most consumers and potential clients would rather drop a message to your social media account, it is more convenient this way.\u00a0 Thus, if you are actively publishing posts on your page, they know you are there so do not ignore their private messages to you.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1699\" src=\"http:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/response-to-problem.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"543\" height=\"212\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/response-to-problem.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/response-to-problem-300x117.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/response-to-problem-600x234.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can set up a custom reply message on your messenger for new messages but don\u2019t leave it at that.\u00a0 Be sure to get back on them in a timely manner.\u00a0 Invest in an advanced automation tool, like <a href=\"http:\/\/jarvee.com\/jarvee-features\/\">JARVEE<\/a>,\u00a0that can speed things up for you in a professional yet non-impersonal level.<\/p>\n<h2>Taking Things Too Personally<\/h2>\n<p>Deleting bad comments, ignoring negative feedback and blocking an account is the most common social media marketing mistakes that can rapidly destroy your online presence.<\/p>\n<p>Whenever you get a bad comment or review, do not react negatively, this will just add more fuel to the fire.\u00a0 Instead, apologize and listen to what they have to say have to say. Take action and learn from the experience.<\/p>\n<h2>Being Narcissist<\/h2>\n<p>It is your page and people get it. \u00a0Still, avoid excessively promoting your business or brand on every opportunity you have.\u00a0 Otherwise, people would quickly lose interest and eventually unfollow or unlike your page if you keep yapping about yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Aside from publishing contents that are related to your products or services, share other interesting and useful write-ups.\u00a0 But be mindful of what you share, do your research so you don\u2019t end up sharing false information.<\/p>\n<h2>Recycling Old Posts<\/h2>\n<p>Recycling is good for the environment but it is not applicable on social media.\u00a0 When you recycle old posts on social media, it is called laziness.<\/p>\n<p>Keep your posts and page up-to-date.\u00a0 Do not limit your efforts to stay fresh with just publishing new posts on a regular basis.\u00a0 Aside from that, change your profile image and cover photo from time to time as well.<\/p>\n<h2>Spamming<\/h2>\n<p>Your social media account is not mainly for promotions and advertising so don\u2019t bombard your readership with spammy links on every post.\u00a0 It is like watching your favorite show loaded with annoying commercials.<\/p>\n<p>A few links are forgivable but don\u2019t overdo it.\u00a0 Consider your social media page as an opportunity to reach out and interact with your clients, much like town halls.<\/p>\n<h2>Being Clueless About Your Followers<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-1700 alignright\" src=\"http:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/clueless.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"290\" height=\"217\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/clueless.png 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/clueless-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/clueless-600x450.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is a classic among the top social media marketing mistakes that online marketers still do.\u00a0 It does not matter how loud you speak, talking to a deaf would not work.\u00a0 You\u2019ll get pretty much the same results when you don\u2019t make an effort to know who your target audience is.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to get optimal engagement on your account, you should work on getting to know your followers.\u00a0 Observe what sparks their interest and when they are most active. Use the data you gathered to help you decide what and when to publish your post.<\/p>\n<h2>Collecting Fake Followers<\/h2>\n<p>A lot of rookie online marketers are lead to believe that massive followers equate to being successful.\u00a0 Well, it can be confusing and there will always be that debate between quantity versus quality.\u00a0 So how do you really measure success?\u00a0 The answer is quite simple, dummies don\u2019t have brains, period.<\/p>\n<h3>Final Thoughts<\/h3>\n<p>Experience is the best teacher and mistake is the finest lesson there is to learn.\u00a0 Knowing failure is half the battle.\u00a0 This is what most, if not all, successful social media marketers share with each other.\u00a0 Thus, we can benefit from their social media marketing mistakes.<\/p>\n<p>However, it does not imply that breathing through the list guarantees instant victory.\u00a0 You are still bound to commit mistakes here and there.\u00a0 But don\u2019t let that stop you.\u00a0 Keep experimenting, combining different methods until you find the balance, that sweet spot and be your own success story.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are a lot of published articles regarding what one can do to grow their social media accounts.\u00a0\u00a0 And while it appears that most online marketers have these best practices at heart, some still find themselves struggling.\u00a0 What could have gone wrong?
