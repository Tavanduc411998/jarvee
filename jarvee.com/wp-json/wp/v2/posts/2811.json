In a nutshell, getting featured is having your work showcased on an Instagram featured account. A featured account (also known as a curation account) covers specific topics, communities, or photography styles and attracts a lot of people. When your work is featured on a curation account, you gain access to the followers. If you have great content, the followers start following you. But the big question is, how do you get featured on Instagram? Here\u2019s how.<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2812\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/5-Simple-Steps-to-Get-Featured-On-Instagram.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"566\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/5-Simple-Steps-to-Get-Featured-On-Instagram.jpg 566w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/5-Simple-Steps-to-Get-Featured-On-Instagram-300x159.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>#1 Search and Study Instagram Accounts You Want To Be Featured In<\/h3>\n<p>If you want to get featured, examine the popular Instagram accounts in your field. Take note of the kind of images they post, their photographic styles, themes, filters, and subject matter. For instance, you cannot submit saturated and harsh photos to an account that features natural and realistic images \u2013 they will never get featured. Featured accounts will not choose your images if they are not similar to what they post regularly.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2813\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/instagram-feature-account.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"329\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/instagram-feature-account.jpg 500w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/instagram-feature-account-300x197.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Another reason why it is important to inspect featured accounts is because the followers already like the style of photos. Since your main aim of getting featured is to get more followers, you have to stick to the same style. If your images are great and get featured, your chances of getting more followers are high.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2814\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/study-guidelines.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"325\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/study-guidelines.jpg 500w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/study-guidelines-300x195.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>#2 Know the Guidelines for Submitting Photos<\/h3>\n<p>In order to have your work displayed on an Instagram featured account, you must follow the set guidelines. Ignoring the rules can work against you. Remember that featured images are chosen by passionate people who search hundreds of images to find the very best. As you submit your images, you have to tag them with the account\u2019s dedicated hashtag. Some accounts ask users to tag them in their pictures, to like their pictures, or to comment on them. Know the rules of the featured account so you can follow them when submitting your work. Use <a>dedicated hashtags correctly<\/a>. Most popular brands and featured accounts scrutinize posts published under their hashtags on a daily basis. That\u2019s how they find new talent to feature on their accounts.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2815\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/tag-brands.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"320\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/tag-brands.jpg 500w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/tag-brands-300x192.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>#3 Take Pictures with Brands&#8217; Products and Tag Them<\/h3>\n<p>Brands love to see their products being advertised. If you have gorgeous images and appropriate hashtags but aren\u2019t being featured on curation accounts, go a step further. Tag your favorite brands and accounts in your photos. For example, if you love a certain photographer\u2019s style, you can try to recreate the style and tag them directly in the picture. They\u2019ll see it and think \u201cThat\u2019s a fan!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>However, note that tagging popular accounts in every image may not always work to your advantage. You may be seen as irrelevant or fake. Therefore, use tags wisely and be choosy. Tag your favorite accounts only in your outstanding pictures or the most relevant. For example, you can pick a brand that regularly showcases the work of its fans and tag them in a photo that shows you using their product creatively.<\/p>\n<p>Another reason why you should not tag your favorite accounts in too many photos is because an Instagram photo feed can get cluttered very quickly. Unlike Facebook, Instagram does not group images into a condensed album. This means that all the images will appear on the accounts\u2019 photo feeds, something that may not go down well with the owners. In addition, the images will also appear on the photo feeds of your followers. Curating content is a hard process, and if your posts are migraine-inducing, you will probably get blocked. Your followers might also lose interest and visit your page to unsubscribe.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2816\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/shoutout.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"323\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/shoutout.jpg 500w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/shoutout-300x194.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>#4 Give &amp;Recieve Shoutouts<\/h3>\n<p>Giving and receiving shoutouts is another great technique to use if you want to get featured on Instagram and expand your reach. The idea is to search for users with content that is similar to yours, reach out to them and offer to give each other shoutouts. This is one of the quickest ways to grow your account and can benefit both parties. But getting a great shoutout can be an uphill task. It requires a lot of networking, and you may have to feature another user\u2019s content on your account before they post your content on their account.<\/p>\n<p>To get a great shoutout, the trick is to find users with more followers than you do. While some users will only agree to a shoutout if you have the same number of followers, some may be willing to give a shoutout if your work is great. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask. But before that, don&#8217;t forget to comment and like the users\u2019 images and follow their accounts. This shows them that you are interested in their content. However, avoid spamming photos with requests for shoutouts. Focus on making a real connection instead.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2817\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/collaboration.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"372\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/collaboration.jpg 500w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/collaboration-300x223.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>#5 Join Forces With Other Influencers in Your Niche<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/systeme.io\/blog\/tips-for-instagram\">Teaming up with influencers<\/a> produces great results. Look for the gurus in your niche and check out their audiences. Having a large following is not enough, successful influencers have the right followers. Such influencers can expose you to new audiences. But building healthy relationships with influencers is not easy so you have to be patient. Once you identify the influencers you want to engage with, start conversations on Instagram. After building rapport, begin communicating via email. You can send them a gift and ask them to share a photo of the gift with their fans.<\/p>\n<p>You can also pair up with influencers and offer shared contests or promotions. You can take an amazing picture, add captions, tag the influencer, and inform people about the contest. When the influencer features the image on his account, he promotes your account to his followers. Use #contest or #promotion when posting the image to make sure people find it easily. You can also ask influencers to repost certain images from your Instagram account. This way, you control the aesthetic and message.<\/p>\n<h3>Wrapping It Up<\/h3>\n<p>If used properly, Instagram can be a powerful advertising tool for a brand. It provides more engagement than other social networks and is a perfect platform for growing a business. However, just like any other social network, you have to get involved if you want to see results. While the tips for getting featured on Instagram are not set in stone, these will come in handy. Participate in the community and getting more followers won\u2019t be a hassle.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Without a doubt, one of the best ways to increase your presence on Instagram is by getting featured. \u201cWhat does getting featured mean?\u201d you may be asking yourself.
