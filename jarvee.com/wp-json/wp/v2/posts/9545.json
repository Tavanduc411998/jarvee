Employees sometimes use their own computers and various unsecured Wi-Fi connections without considering any security measures. That&#8217;s why it is so important for the company to ensure that all data will remain safe and secure.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s also what this article will focus on. Below, there are ten tips for a sales team on keeping communication secure, including using online fax services, monitoring for phishing scams, educating employees on online security, purchasing antivirus software for all remote employees, and many more.<\/p>\n<p>And while all of them seem obvious, many businesses still fail to implement them when creating their <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-to-overcome-cyber-security-risks-in-digital-marketing\/\">cybersecurity<\/a> strategy.<\/p>\n<h2>Online Fax Services<\/h2>\n<p>Although sending faxes is not a favorable option for file exchange, it\u2019s one of the most secure ways for sales teams to communicate. By using reliable <a href=\"https:\/\/www.faxburner.com\/\">efax free<\/a> or paid services, businesses can send faxes without the need for fax machines whatsoever. What\u2019s more, such services use the newest technology to ensure security and reliability when sending files containing sensitive company information. All it takes to start faxing online is downloading an app or a designated software. Such applications are available on all popular devices, providing businesses with convenience not many other options can match.<\/p>\n<h2>Monitor for Phishing Scams<\/h2>\n<p>Phishing scams are one of the most common ways to expose any company data. They are used to trick employees into giving out their passwords, bank details, or other private information. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techrepublic.com\/article\/why-employees-still-fall-for-phishing-emails\/\">According to various studies<\/a>, the average phishing email is opened five times before being deleted. In addition, other research revealed that 70% of all employees who received phishing emails clicked on the links. This means that every employee should be educated on phishing scams and how to avoid them.<\/p>\n<h2>Educating Employees on Online Security<\/h2>\n<p>Every employee should be made aware of the company&#8217;s online security policy. They need to know what kind of personal information they can share online and how to communicate securely with their colleagues. Some companies use Business Email Compromise (BEC) to educate their employees on how scammers work.<\/p>\n<p>Remote worker training is also a great way to educate employees about security breaches. It is possible to create an online training program and then train employees by sending them the link to the course and having them complete it on their own time and schedule.<\/p>\n<h2>Purchasing Antivirus Software for All Remote Employees<\/h2>\n<p>Most antivirus software nowadays comes with a free version that can be used for remote employees. This can be used to protect all of any company\u2019s employees from viruses, spyware, and malware. As a result, this will reduce the chances of security breaches and make any business more efficient.<\/p>\n<h2>Restricting Access to Sensitive Information<\/h2>\n<p>If a sales team is working remotely, it\u2019s vital to make sure that they don&#8217;t have access to sensitive information via apps or any social media networks. For example, Salesforce restricts access to storage containers unless someone has the appropriate permissions or is signed in as a user with administrative permissions.<\/p>\n<h2>Not Using Unsecured Wi-Fi Networks<\/h2>\n<p>When using public Wi-Fi networks, our device is vulnerable to many attacks. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s very important to avoid unsecured Wi-Fi connections whenever possible and never share any sensitive information on public networks. Anytime someone connects to the public internet, they should do it through a VPN so that they can safely exchange files and documents while working remotely.<\/p>\n<h2>Using VPN<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/news\/4-reasons-your-business-should-use-a-vpn-service\">Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)<\/a> are one of the best ways to make sure data is always safe while working remotely. They provide a secure connection between one\u2019s computer and a VPN server, which means that all the data will go through an encrypted tunnel before reaching its destination. It works like an encrypted tunnel between a device and a VPN server in another country. This way, hackers won&#8217;t be able (or will find it extremely difficult) to steal personal information while using unsecured Wi-Fi networks.<\/p>\n<p>Another great thing about using a VPN is that it is relatively cheap and there are many business plans available. All that makes a VPN one of the best solutions a company can consider to keep their communication secure.<\/p>\n<h2>Using Two-Factor Authentication<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/22215571\/factor-authentication-2fa-apple-microsoft-google-how-to\">Two-factor authentication (2FA)<\/a> is an essential security method that every company should use when managing its employees remotely. It requires both a password and a special code that is generated by an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy. By using 2FA, one can make sure that only their employees can access the company&#8217;s accounts and not a fraudster posing as one of them.<\/p>\n<h2>Using a Secure Virtual Meeting Software<\/h2>\n<p>One of the most secure ways to hold a virtual meeting is by using secure virtual meeting software. This allows employees to chat with other participants in real-time. The best part is that it\u2019s possible to keep the chat logs encrypted and delete them after the meeting is over. What\u2019s more, there is multiple secure virtual meeting software out there so employers can try them out and see which one is better for their team. However, as a rule of thumb, it is always best to use only the most renowned programs, such as Microsoft Teams, Skype, or Zoom. With a plethora of choices, no company should find it difficult to find something for itself.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9549 \" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/remote-employee.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"802\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/remote-employee.png 512w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/remote-employee-300x199.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Being a remote employee doesn&#8217;t mean someone has to sacrifice their security. In fact, it\u2019s possible to keep the data completely safe by using the above-mentioned tips and tools by making sure their employees know how to avoid phishing scams, educating them on online security, purchasing antivirus software for all remote employees, restricting access to sensitive information, always encrypting sensitive data, not using unsecured Wi-Fi networks, setting up a VPN for your remote employees, or using 2FA for all remote employees&#8217; accounts.<\/p>\n<p>This way, employers can ensure their sales teams will be able to create a safe and secure working environment and ensure that the company&#8217;s data is always protected!<\/p>\n<h2>Author&#8217;s Bio<\/h2>\n<p>Paul Pleasant is Freelance cybersecurity advisor and IT specialist.
