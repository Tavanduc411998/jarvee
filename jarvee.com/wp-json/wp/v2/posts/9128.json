There are many ways that you can automate your business procedures, and with the rise of at-home work, <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-businesses-use-ai-in-social-media-marketing-to-grow-faster\/\">there are more options every day<\/a>. Sometimes all it takes is the right software and you can fix a problem you may not have even known you had. Here are some of the best workflow automation <a href=\"https:\/\/servicelist.io\/article\/business-softwares\">business software<\/a> for 2021 and beyond.<\/p>\n<h2>Monday.com<\/h2>\n<p>Monday.com is a fantastic project management tool that makes it as simple as possible to develop clear, actionable workflows. Are you currently using a spreadsheet for your project management? Monday has been developed to work similarly to spreadsheets, in that you can list your tasks, and then fill in what you need to complete those tasks. It\u2019s much more robust than a spreadsheet since it also has notifications, integrations, and options for deleting tasks.<\/p>\n<p>You can switch up the view so that you can sort by project, due date, or even by the geographic locations of the assignees. With all of its integrations, it can take data from calendar apps, email, shared drives, and much more to provide a full big-picture view of all of your projects and tasks.<\/p>\n<h2>Zapier<\/h2>\n<p>Zapier is geared towards marketing projects. It has an easy-to-use app and interface that almost anyone can pick up quickly. It offers hundreds of integrations, so you can get it up and running with your team in no time at all. Since its focus is marketing, it has an extra capability for email marketing and <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.racemi.com\/what-you-are-doing-wrong-with-your-social-media-marketing\/\">social media campaigns<\/a><\/u>, along with a strong document sharing feature. It offers notifications when any tasks have been completed, so everyone on the team is in the loop at all times. Email sign-ups and lead captures are all down automatically, so you can spend your time working on campaigns and not doing the busy work.<\/p>\n<h2>Yooz<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9132\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/yooz.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"349\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/yooz.png 949w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/yooz-300x164.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/yooz-768x419.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/yooz-600x328.png 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/yooz-400x218.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Accounts payable processes are particularly time-consuming and mind-numbing, but they are absolutely necessary. When you receive an invoice, you need to process the data, enter it in your general ledger or database, get approvals, and then process the payment. This takes time and effort, even though it is a process that can be easily automated.<\/p>\n<p>With Yooz, you can get <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.getyooz.com\/automated-invoice-processing\">automated invoice processing<\/a><\/u> that will make sure that your bills get paid and your data is properly updated. There is no risk of human error along the way, and approvals are a snap. With fast, automatic accounts payable processing, you can take advantage of any early payment discounts and avoid late penalties from having an envelope sitting on someone\u2019s desk for too long.<\/p>\n<h2>Kissflow<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9130\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/kissflow.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/kissflow.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/kissflow-300x188.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/kissflow-600x375.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Kissflow is a robust enterprise workflow management software that provides all of the bells and whistles that you could want.
