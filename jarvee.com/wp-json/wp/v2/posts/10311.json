It has taken over because it&#8217;s fun, easy to use, and allows people to create comedic content in a matter of seconds. With that being said &#8211; some tricks will help you maximize your TikTok experience.<\/p>\n<p>Here are six quick tips for taking your TikTok game up a level.<\/p>\n<h3>Update Your Profile<\/h3>\n<p>The first step to making your TikTok better than ever is by updating and optimizing your profile. Make sure you have a fun, catchy intro or bio that will make people want to follow you. Don&#8217;t forget your location and link so people can find you outside of TikTok. You need to learn <a href=\"https:\/\/linkinbio.xyz\/enable-and-customize-your-tiktok-website-url\/\">how to add link to Tiktok bio <\/a>to keep your fans updated. Your username should also be easy for people to remember to find you more easily on the app.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, Don&#8217;t forget the hashtags! Add popular ones like #music and #trending or trending hashtags in TikTok to get more likes and followers on TikTok. This ensures you can be found by more people and increases your chances of becoming more popular. However, please do not overdo it with hashtags. Nobody likes spammy TikTok accounts.<\/p>\n<h3>Take Advantage of Polls &amp; Memes<\/h3>\n<p>Polls on TikTok are a great way to get your audience involved. Memes have also been the trend lately, so it&#8217;s essential to take advantage of them as well! Make sure you&#8217;re using <a href=\"https:\/\/influencermarketinghub.com\/top-tiktok-hashtags\/\">hashtags that are trending<\/a> or popular for maximum exposure.<\/p>\n<p>You can either create memes from scratch or use existing ones. However, this can be risky because if you use an existing meme, it might get removed from TikTok due to copyright infringement. So make sure you do your research before using other memes. Also, ensure the memes you use align with your brand. This will help you maintain a cohesive image all across social media platforms. Last but not least, make sure the memes are funny or relatable.<\/p>\n<h3>Keep Followers in Mind<\/h3>\n<p>This is an obvious one that most people probably don&#8217;t even think about. When you are creating videos for TikTok &#8211; keep your followers in mind when choosing content to post!<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t just post something because it&#8217;s funny, interesting, or entertaining. Be conscious of what type of content will appeal to your audience and watch the likes roll in. This will definitely help you expand your audience and grow a community of dedicated fans<\/p>\n<h3>Use Special Occasions as Inspirations<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10314\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Use-Special-Occasions-as-Inspirations.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Use-Special-Occasions-as-Inspirations.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Use-Special-Occasions-as-Inspirations-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Use-Special-Occasions-as-Inspirations-600x399.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This one may seem like a no-brainer, but it&#8217;s worth mentioning. If you want to get more followers on TikTok &#8211; use special occasions as inspiration for your videos. For example: if April Fool&#8217;s Day is coming up, try making some funny pranks or jokes relevant to the holiday. It will provide you with a creative way of engaging with your audience, and it will also help you establish yourself as an active TikTok user!<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to get out of the box here. If Christmas or Thanksgiving is coming up, maybe try creating some original content around those holidays too. Remember &#8211; it&#8217;s all about creativity, so use whatever inspiration comes your way.<\/p>\n<h3>Don&#8217;t Post Too Often But Don&#8217;t Be Lazy Either<\/h3>\n<p>People might think this is a no-brainer, but there are some people out there who post too often and others that never seem to make any content. While it&#8217;s fantastic if you <a href=\"https:\/\/influencermarketinghub.com\/what-is-tiktok\/\">love making TikTok<\/a> videos &#8211; you want to try your best not to overdo it or come off as lazy. A good rule of thumb for most social media platforms is to post once or twice a day.<\/p>\n<p>For some, that might be too little, and for others, it may seem like you&#8217;re posting too much! Just try your best not to overdo it. There&#8217;s nothing worse than an unenthusiastic TikTok&#8217;er who posts every hour with no real substance.<\/p>\n<h3>Include a CTA in Your Content<\/h3>\n<p>Another great way to get followers is to include CTAs within your TikTok videos. It&#8217;s straightforward and does not take much time at all &#8211; but it will provide you with excellent results! The most popular types of calls-to-action are: &#8216;Follow us on Instagram&#8217; and &#8216;Follow us on Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on how active you are, try to add one of these once a day. If your following is huge &#8211; maybe even every video. This will definitely help you expand your social media presence. Plus, it&#8217;s simple and easy for people to follow along with what you&#8217;re doing.<\/p>\n<h3>Study What Other Tik Tok Users are Doing<\/h3>\n<p>Another cool trick to get more followers on TikTok is by studying other users. Please make a list of your top five favorite accounts and see what they&#8217;re doing right! What kind of content do they post? Are their videos similar in style or theme as yours are?<\/p>\n<p>The best way to study them would be through hashtags. You should make a list of the top hashtags they are using. This will give you an idea as to what kind of content is popular on TikTok at this time and which type of videos other users like watching. Once again, we can&#8217;t stress enough how important it is to do your research! You don&#8217;t want to post something that isn&#8217;t popular or that your audience will not enjoy.<\/p>\n<h3>Collaborate With Popular TikTok Users<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10312\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Collaborate-With-Popular-TikTok-Users.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Collaborate-With-Popular-TikTok-Users.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Collaborate-With-Popular-TikTok-Users-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Collaborate-With-Popular-TikTok-Users-600x338.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Another <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/5-tiktok-tips-and-tricks-to-becoming-viral-fast\/\">secret to getting more followers on Tik Tok<\/a> is by collaborating with other popular users. For this strategy to work, you need to find a popular user in your niche or that has a similar audience as you do. This will help increase the exposure of both accounts and bring in new fans!<\/p>\n<p>If possible &#8211; try teaming up with a popular user and posting some content together. This could be anything from creating video responses to each other or even doing challenges on TikTok. Don&#8217;t worry about being competitive. Embrace the fact that you&#8217;re both trying to get more fans and followers in your area of interest. After all &#8211; the two-person team is always more robust than the individual.<\/p>\n<p>There are tons of other TikTok tricks out there that will help you get more followers. It all comes down to experimenting with different strategies and seeing what works for your account. Just remember to keep things interesting, fresh, and engaging, or else you&#8217;ll lose fans in no time at all.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Author<\/h3>\n<p>Cheyenne Quinn is an experienced writer that specializes in the digital and influencer marketing field.\u00a0 She loves traveling and is passionate about learning about different cultures.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>TikTok is the latest social media app to take over.
