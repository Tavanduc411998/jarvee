Active users<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Instagram has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/272014\/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users\/\">more than 1 billion active users<\/a> monthly. It was in June 2018, when this platform first passed the benchmark of 1 billion active users monthly. The number has continued to increase gently since then. By 2023, it is estimated that the US will have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/293771\/number-of-us-instagram-users\/\">active users up to 125.5 million<\/a> per month.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Image-1-3-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"743\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6080\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Image-1-3-6.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Image-1-3-6-300x223.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Image-1-3-6-768x571.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Image-1-3-6-600x446.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4><strong>2. Regularity of use<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Instagram is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/internet\/chart\/how-often-americans-are-using-social-media\/\">social media platform that has most log in<\/a> after Facebook. More than 60% of Instagram users check the platform at least one time daily. 21% of Instagram users check the platform weekly and only 16% of users log in less frequently.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>3. Time users spend on Instagram<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>If you are looking to determine the level of engagement of a social media platform, this is your best bet. The amount of time that Instagram users spend on the platform is as much as users of Facebook do on the platform. While Facebook users spend an average of 58 minutes daily on the platform, Instagram users spend an average of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oberlo.com\/blog\/instagram-stats-every-marketer-should-know\">53 minutes daily<\/a> on the network.<\/p>\n<p>This implies that Instagram is a very engaging network and the users will be more open to brand contents.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>4. Users with high followers<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Instagram as a social network is used by hundreds of celebrities worldwide. Celebrities attract a large number of followers. So, it is not surprising that football superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has the highest number of Instagram followers with 196.7 million followers with Ariana Grande and Dwayne Johnson with 171.5 million each.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>5. Instagram accounts<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/italian-security-researchers-find-8-percent-of-instagram-accounts-are-fake-2015-7?IR=T\">study<\/a> of Instagram accounts found that 29.9% of accounts on Instagram are not active, meaning that they post very few or no videos or photos in a period of 30 days. The study also found that 8% of Instagram accounts are not real accounts.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>6. Instagram posts<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>More than 100 million Instagram posts are made every day. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-facebook-instagram-users\/instagrams-user-base-grows-to-more-than-500-million-idUSKCN0Z71LN\">research<\/a> carried out in June 2016, showed that Instagram users worldwide made up to 95 million posts daily. Considering, that was 4 years ago, the figures are likely to have increased greatly today.<\/p>\n<h3>Instagram user statistics<\/h3>\n<h4><strong>7. Age<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>A report from Statista shows that Instagram is a social network that has predominantly younger people on it. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/248769\/age-distribution-of-worldwide-instagram-users\/\">report<\/a> shows that over 50% of Instagram users are less than 34 years of age. In the US, for example, teenagers use this social network more after Snapchat. The age group that uses Instagram the most is 18-24.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>8. Gender<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/802776\/distribution-of-users-on-instagram-worldwide-gender\/\">gender slit on Instagram<\/a> is quite even than on many other social networks.
