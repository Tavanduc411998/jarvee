Yup, that totally makes sense.  Though sometimes I follow them back to return the favor then mute them if need be or unfollow them after some time.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Another reason why people unfollow you is that you don&#039;t follow them back. Which is perfectly OK in my opinion. I used to follow everyone back in the past, but that only made me get a lot of uninteresting content on my feed and people who I wouldn&#039;t ever talk to. Now I only follow back people who has content that really catches my eye.]]></description>

It&#039;s not an unusual thing to happen. If you lose a lot in one day, then numbers stay stable for couple of days, and then again you lose a lot, it&#039;s highly likely you&#039;ve been followed by a lot of fake (spam) accounts and Instagram bans them occasionally. 

Did you make any major changes on your IG profile recently? That could also be one of the explanations, maybe your followers don&#039;t like the changes you made, i.e. posting different type of content than you used to. What about engagement on your posts? Do you get likes and comments?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, I understand that people get excited when they get or create great photos or video and they want to share everything as soon as possible, but posting too much content at once can seem spammy to your followers and this is one of the reasons why I personally unfollowed some profiles. Besides, you should keep this content and share it at the right time and get more value from it.]]></description>

I&#039;m not sure what were you trying to say, but if you refer to latest IG problem that occurred two days ago when users started losing followers, then there should be nothing to worry about since Instagram announced it&#039;s bug on their side and it will be fixed soon.]]></description>
