					<description><![CDATA[I noticed that I started using Instagram as search engine, first I go to check something on hashtag search and then I remember that Google is still there  I think I switched here because I know that it&#039;s easy to check between top hashtags what we are looking for and since we spend a lot of time on social networks you feel like it&#039;s faster to do it from there.]]></description>
