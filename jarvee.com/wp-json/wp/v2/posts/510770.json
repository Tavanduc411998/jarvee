With over 1 billion hours of YouTube being streamed every day, YouTube has quickly become the forerunner of marketing platforms. Studies show that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialmediaexaminer.com\/social-media-marketing-industry-report-2020\/\">55% of marketers<\/a> now use YouTube as a means to promote their product or service, with an increasing number of people replicating this day by day.<\/p>\n<p>The most efficient market trends of recent times are those that prioritize a unique and interesting strategy. We will hence be highlighting some of these prevalence trends that you can use today to derive benefits from this ever-growing platform.<\/p>\n<h3>Trend 1: Immersive Shopping<\/h3>\n<p>Me, you, and probably everyone with a mobile phone has practiced immersive shopping at some point in our lives. Studies claim that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S2405844020317230\">80% of people review a product<\/a> on YouTube before actually buying it, which is the purpose of immersive shopping: create an interactive experience for your customer to get familiar with your product or service.<\/p>\n<p>The efficiency of this type of marketing is borne from the emotional connection that is formed with the consumer: which is achieved today by different ideas like \u2018product unboxing\u2019, \u2018shop with me\u201d and many more we see on YouTube today. YouTube being the second most used search engine in the world obviously contributes to the efficiency of such videos.<\/p>\n<h3>Trend 2: Docuseries<\/h3>\n<p>Blended from the words documentary and series, docuseries are documentary-style series that are revealed periodically in the form of episodes. These have greatly caught the eye of the average entertainment Consumer with Netflix\u2019s special \u201cTiger king\u201d being the most recent international hit.<\/p>\n<p>Docuseries are very effective due to their periodic nature, which often leaves a consumer wanting for more i.e another episode. These allow creators to really explore a particular phenomenon and publish hours of content with the same magnitude of anticipation and excitement, something which would not have been possible had it only been a typical 90-minute documentary.<\/p>\n<p>YouTube itself reported in 2020 that 46% of survey respondents would be more willing to watch content that is more than 20 minutes long. This is hence a really solid way of marketing our brand, and one that is not to be missed out on.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-510772\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Gaming-Live-streaming.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"351\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Gaming-Live-streaming.png 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Gaming-Live-streaming-300x165.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Gaming-Live-streaming-600x329.png 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Gaming-Live-streaming-400x218.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Trend 3: Gaming Live streaming<\/h3>\n<p>Gaming is taking over. The <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/influencer-marketing-trends-in-the-gaming-industry\/\">gaming industry is one of the fastest-growing industries<\/a> in the world and would be worth over 180 billion dollars by the end of 2021, studies estimate. A big reason for this growth can be attributed to the live streaming sessions being held by gamers on YouTube. Two of the five most subscribed accounts on YouTube are gamers, who have amassed these followers by playing different games on their channels live, famous YouTuber <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PewDiePie\">PewDiePie<\/a> being an example.<\/p>\n<p>These Individuals and channels are open to sponsorships and promotions, and a really good way to expose our product to a very big audience. Gaming live streams continue to be the thing today, and it looks like this will be the case for a long time. So it might finally be time for you to reach out to one of these individuals.<\/p>\n<h3>Trend 4: Hashtags<\/h3>\n<p>For potential customers to see and explore our product, they first have to find it. One way to ensure exposure is to add hashtags. Hashtags have existed forever on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter but have had little standing on YouTube. That has changed recently though, with the introduction of hashtag landing pages.<\/p>\n<p>Hashtags in essence are clickable words that redirect users to a different page with content of the same sort. An example of a hashtag could be \u2018#downloadmusictoipods\u2019, something one would type if someone is interested in learning to <a href=\"https:\/\/softorino.com\/waltr\/other\/how-put-music-ipod-classic\/\">downloading music to iPods<\/a>, which, by the way, could be done easily by WALTR PRO of Softorino.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-510774\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/YouTube-Ads.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"427\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/YouTube-Ads.png 947w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/YouTube-Ads-300x214.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/YouTube-Ads-768x547.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/YouTube-Ads-600x427.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Trend 5: Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Saving the best for the last, it will be of no surprise to anyone that YouTube ads right now are arguably the best way for promotion. More and more brands and individuals are investing in YouTube ads, a wise investment considering YouTube is the second most famous website in the world, second only to Google.<\/p>\n<p>YouTube ads have quickly taken over their biggest competitor in TV ads, mostly because of their edge in prices, efficiency and exposure. Hence, invest in ads now to make sure you get maximum exhibition for your product or service.<\/p>\n<h3>Trend 6: Short on-the-go videos<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram attracted a lot of audiences thanks to the short on-the-go videos. In fact, statistics suggest that video content gets 48% more engagement than text or images on social media. This clearly shows that short videos are the future.<\/p>\n<p>Keeping all of this in mind, YouTube has decided to take on the big names and have entered the arena of shot on-the-go videos. Starting from late 2020, YouTube allowed content creators to create short on-the-go videos just like TikTok, and since then, the platform has seen immense growth. In less than a year, these videos have become fan favorites and you can expect these short videos to become a thing for 2022 as well!<\/p>\n<h2>How to leverage these YouTube trends for your brand?<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-510773\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Marketing-on-YouTube.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"334\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Marketing-on-YouTube.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Marketing-on-YouTube-200x300.jpg 200w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Marketing-on-YouTube-600x899.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now comes the real question. How a start-up or a business can leverage these YouTube trends for the benefit of the business.<\/p>\n<p>Following are some tips that you can use to ensure that you are capitalizing on these trends to the fullest extent.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Start with short on-the-go videos<\/h3>\n<p>Research shows that 68% of people are more likely to watch a business video if the video is less than a minute long. This means if you are in the starting phase, it\u2019s a good idea to start your marketing with short on-the-go videos as these videos have a good chance of going viral.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Use YouTube targeting to your advantage<\/h3>\n<p>Starting your marketing campaign with a limited budget? If so, then you must use YouTube targeting wisely.<\/p>\n<p>YouTube targeting allows a plethora of options to market your product or business to the right audience and you can show your ads to different people based on their interests, ages, demographics, etc and if chosen wisely, YouTube targeting can do wonders for your business!<\/p>\n<p>A key to this is to conduct proper research of the market and the competition and see the audience your competitors are targeting.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Be persistent and create quality content<\/h3>\n<p>This is an extremely important point and I cannot emphasize enough this. The success of a marketing campaign depends on how persistent you are and it\u2019s all about putting in the hard work persistently. As long as you are persistent and focusing on creating quality content- you will succeed!<\/p>\n<h2>Wrapping it up<\/h2>\n<p>If you aren&#8217;t using any of these trends in marketing our product in 2021, chances are you&#8217;re not getting the utmost attention and views.
