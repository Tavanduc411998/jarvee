If you\u2019re not on Reels just yet, you could be missing out on a huge opportunity to get discovered. To help you get started, we\u2019ve listed the ways you can use <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/why-and-how-to-use-instagram-reels-for-your-brand\/\">Instagram Reels to Increase your followers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Introduce Yourself<\/h3>\n<p>If you were to summarize your brand in 30 seconds, how would you do it? Posting on Instagram Reels means you are introducing yourself to people who may not have heard about you. It\u2019s important to make a good first impression.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9015\" style=\"width: 511px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9015\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-9015 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Introduce-Yourself.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"501\" height=\"440\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Introduce-Yourself.png 501w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Introduce-Yourself-300x263.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-9015\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/artsandfood\/\">source<\/a><\/p><\/div>\n<p>Food and parenting duo Dayna and Brian Lee, better known as @artsandfood, published a \u201cTHIS IS US\u201d video on Instagram Reels that perfectly summarizes what they\u2019re all about.

Think as far back as 2008 when everyone started taking photos of themselves \u201cplanking\u201d in the most obscure places or the Running Man Challenge that went viral in 2016. People love challenges, so why not start one on Instagram Reels?<\/p>\n<p>Following the concept of <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/5-tiktok-tips-and-tricks-to-becoming-viral-fast\/\">TikTok Challenges<\/a>, your Instagram Reel Challenge should use a hashtag. Think of a hashtag that can be associated with your brand but can also be used naturally. One of the most successful branded challenges was the #ShowMeYourWalk Challenge by Chase Bank.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9017\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9017\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-9017\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Start-a-Challenge.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"558\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Start-a-Challenge.png 318w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Start-a-Challenge-269x300.png 269w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-9017\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/\">source<\/a><\/p><\/div>\n<p>Start a challenge to commemorate an event, launch a campaign or support a cause that your brand is passionate about.

Chase Bank partnered up with one of their ambassadors, Kevin Hart whose video has over 3.8 million views.<\/p>\n<h3>Leverage Viral Content<\/h3>\n<p>As a brand or content creator, you should be on top of trends. Look at what\u2019s trending on Instagram Reels and even on TikTok and add your own spin to it. When you <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.luhhu.com\/blog\/how-to-succeed-by-automating-content-production-and-planning\">produce content <\/a><\/u>that is already going viral on other platforms, it <u><a href=\"https:\/\/hyax.com\/post\/content-creator\">increases the chances<\/a><\/u> of performing well on Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9016\" style=\"width: 634px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9016\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-9016 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Leverage-Viral-Content.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"308\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Leverage-Viral-Content.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Leverage-Viral-Content-300x148.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Leverage-Viral-Content-600x296.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-9016\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/vanessalau.co\/\">source<\/a><\/p><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Vanessa Lau (@vanessalau.co), an Instagram Growth Expert takes inspiration from viral content on TikTok and applies it to her Instagram Reels. Doing this has helped her drastically <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=d4sfvMMCfg8\">increased her reach<\/a><\/u>, engagement, and follower count in a span of just a month.<\/p>\n<p>When <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.podium.com\/article\/viral-marketing\/\">leveraging viral content<\/a><\/u>, don\u2019t forget to create content that\u2019s still meant for your niche. While simply riding on viral audio and content might get you the views, these views won\u2019t necessarily translate to follows if there\u2019s a mismatch.<\/p>\n<h3>Keep it Real<\/h3>\n<p>Influencers and celebrities often get a bad rap for posting about their highly edited posts on Instagram. Nobody really gets to see the 100+ shots that were taken before it was good enough to make the grid. While beautifully staged shots still garner hundreds of thousands of likes, social media users have become more discerning. Consumers are now looking for brands that are more \u201cauthentic\u201d \u2014 use Instagram Reels to start.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve just posted a photo on your grid, for example, you can support it with a clip-on Instagram Reels about how you got to the final shot. This can be a behind-the-scenes bloopers type of video or it can even serve as a photo-editing tutorial.<\/p>\n<p>As a brand, another way to show a more authentic and human side is through takeovers. According to research, 70% of consumers feel more connected to a brand when the CEO has an active social presence. Use reels to show \u201ca day in the life\u201d videos of your employees and other people behind the brand.<\/p>\n<p>Posting content that\u2019s original and unscripted will encourage more brand loyalty and as a result, increase your followers.<\/p>\n<h3>&#8230;But stay on-brand<\/h3>\n<p>By on-brand, we don\u2019t necessarily mean being too careful about branding standards such as colors and filters. When posting content on Instagram Reels, you still have to think about how it reflects back on your brand.<\/p>\n<p>If you post something that\u2019s completely off topic and unrelated to your brand, you may get views and follows, but they won\u2019t be valuable leads. You want to attract people who are not just interested in the content you post on Reels but are also potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>When posting anything on social media, it\u2019s important to be intentional. Ask yourself: What value will this serve? Make sure that you\u2019re always creating relevant content that connects you to the right people.<\/p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>While many may still look at Instagram Reels as just another copy of TikTok, it would be a mistake to dismiss it. After all, the company has a history of taking a concept and making it better. Remember how Instagram Stories started? Now it has over <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessofapps.com\/data\/instagram-statistics\/\">500 million<\/a><\/u> daily active users.<\/p>\n<p>With <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uscreen.tv\/blog\/live-streaming-statistics\/\">34% of GenZ\u2019s<\/a><\/u> using social media to get their news, <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.foximusic.com\/10-video-marketing-stats-2017\/\">92% of marketers<\/a><\/u> believe that video is effective for brand awareness. These numbers just prove how brands should leverage video marketing. Take advantage of Instagram Reels\u2019 early stages.
