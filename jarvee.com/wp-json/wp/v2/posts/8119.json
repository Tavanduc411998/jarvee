There is no other social media site on which people \u201ctweet.\u201d Tweeting simply involves typing and sharing opinions and thoughts rather than sharing pictures and videos. So, Twitter is the best social site for intellectual discussions. In recent times, there are more uploads of other information media but it has hardly changed how much of an intellectual platform Twitter is.<br \/>\nTwitter\u2019s position as a platform for intelligent discussions makes it an appropriate marketing tool for writers.<br \/>\nAs an aspiring writer, it is expedient to create advantageous to be active on Twitter because tweeting is basically writing; hence, you can improve your writing skills while using social media. As a writer, being active on Twitter also helps you hone your skills and connect with other writers. <\/p>\n<p>Many writers are <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/twitter-optimization-tips-for-2019\/\">optimizing Twitter<\/a> to sell their talent. Storytellers, content writers, copywriters, songwriters, etc. are all using the platform to sell their talent and skills. Below, we have enumerated a few ideas that can help you to effectively market yourself as a writer on Twitter. <\/p>\n<h2>Create a Suitable and Complete Profile<\/h2>\n<p>Your Twitter profile should be complete with the following components:<br \/>\nHandle: Your handle is the name by which you can be identified and it is unique to you. It begins with \u201c@\u201d which depicts that it leads to a particular account on most social media platforms. Also, your Twitter handle is in form of a link; clicking it will take any person to your profile immediately. Since your handle is your identification, it is important to use a name that you would like to be identified by. If you write under your full name, you should use your full name. If you write or aim to get published using your pseudonym, then we also advise that you use your pseudonym. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Display Name<\/strong>: In your profile, your display name appears over your handle. It is like the handle, but it is not in form of a link that leads directly to your profile. Your display name should also be a name that you are or would like to be known by. People change their display names more regularly than they change their handle. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Profile Picture<\/strong>: Like every social media platform, Twitter has an opening on your profile for a picture to be identified with. I advise that you use a clear picture of yourself; one that explicitly shows your facial features, at least. Nevertheless, if you feel uncomfortable sharing your picture on the internet, you can hold up on that for the time being. Instead of using your picture, you could use something else that is related to writing or that shows your prowess as a writer; a screenshot of your favorite piece, perhaps. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Header<\/strong>: This is another space for a picture on your profile. As the name implies, it is usually at the top of your profile. Advisably, you should use a picture that shows a project that you have worked on or are presently working on. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Bio<\/strong>: Your bio is a space of 160 characters reversed for a description of yourself. To create a great bio, you have to be creatively brief as there is hardly enough room to expatiate. State that you are a writer and explain what drives you. Also, I advise that you state your qualifications and experience. There are many <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/twitter-bio-ideas\/\">great ideas<\/a> to incorporate when writing a great bio.<br \/>\n<strong>URL<\/strong>: There is a field in which you can input the link to a site on your bio. If you own a website, placing the link in this field can help more people read your work. <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Twitter-Optimization-Tips-2019.jpg\" alt=\"Twitter Optimization Tips 2019\" width=\"909\" height=\"471\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4245\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Twitter-Optimization-Tips-2019.jpg 909w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Twitter-Optimization-Tips-2019-300x155.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Twitter-Optimization-Tips-2019-768x398.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Twitter-Optimization-Tips-2019-600x311.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 909px) 100vw, 909px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Be Active <\/h2>\n<p>If you are going to effectively market yourself on Twitter, you cannot escape being active on the site. You are probably already afraid because you feel that this means you have to spend most of your time than is necessary on social media. However, it is not so. You just have to ensure that you tweet whenever you are online. However, this is not a license to tweet mindlessly. I advise that you tweet more about the subjects that you are voluble about. Apart from tweeting, you can also retweet, reply to tweets, quote tweets, and like them. These activities help you to gather more followers and mutuals, thereby promoting growing your account and marketing yourself as a writer.<br \/>\nFurthermore, if you feel that tweeting is hectic, I advise that you schedule your tweets. There are different tools on the internet with which you can schedule your tweets even months ahead. If you utilize this tool, you would be able to tweet regularly without always being online on Twitter. <\/p>\n<h2>Follow Famous\/Influential People in Your Writing Niche <\/h2>\n<p>Some so many famous writers own Twitter accounts. Keeping up with their work, posts, and content will inspire you to be better at your craft. Apart from inspiration, you also get knowledge from following these established writers as they sometimes share ideas and suggestions that have helped them excel as writers. <\/p>\n<h2>Promote Other Writers<\/h2>\n<p>Promoting other writers will also help to put you in the limelight. Of course, as a writer, many of your mutuals will be writers. Also, there will be a lot of writing content on your timeline. For instance, you could say, \u201cAnytime I need help to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.australianwritings.com\/do-my-assignment\/\">do my assignment<\/a>, I get help from (insert writer\u2019s handle)\u201d. Whenever a tweet about your fellow writer comes up, you should engage it. This shows your account as one that cares about your writing; hence, other people who follow content about the subject will follow you.<br \/>\nIt is also great to engage, support, and promote other writers just because they need the exposure. Engaging J.K. Rowlings\u2019 tweets might not make much of a difference to her exposure, but it will to a less famous writer. <\/p>\n<h2>Share Your Work <\/h2>\n<p>If you do not share your work as a writer, how are people going to know how great you are? From time to time, you should upload links of your work to Twitter for your followers to read. Nevertheless, if all you do on Twitter is share links to your writings and leave, you would hardly get any exposure. You also have to do other things that will enable gather an audience; being active on the site is at the top of this list. This further helps you to hone your skills as a professional writer. <\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion <\/h2>\n<p>Twitter is not a very easy site to grow followers on. People tend to ignore your tweets, profile, and other attempts at marketing and becoming more established. Your best bets are to be more active, engage tweets, create an attractive profile, and tweet regularly on topics that you are voluble about.    <\/p>\n<h4>Author Bio<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Jennifer Holland<\/strong> is a professional writer who has been writing about education, student life, and career development for several years.
