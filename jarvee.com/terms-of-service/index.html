<p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS DO NOT INSTALL OR ACCESS THE SOFTWARE OR OTHERWISE INDICATE REFUSAL, MAKE NO FURTHER USE OF THE SOFTWARE</p>
<p>By using the jarvee.com web site (“Service” or “Software” owned by ABC E-Commerce Services) you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions (“Terms of Service”).</p>
<p>We reserves the right to update and change the Terms of Service from time to time without notice. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. Continued use of the Software after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time at: http://jarvee.com/ terms-of-service/</p>
<p>Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your Account. You agree to use the Software at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Account terms</strong></p>
<p>You must be 13 years or older to use this Software. If you are less than 18 years of age, you cannot use the JARVEE Product without the consent of your parent or guardian, who agrees, on your behalf, that you will comply with the Terms of Service.</p>
<p>You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.</p>
<p>You must provide your legal full name, a valid email address, and any other information requested in order to complete the signup process.</p>
<p>Your login may only be used by one person – a single login shared by multiple people is not permitted. You may create separate logins for as many people as your plan allows.</p>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</p>
<p>You are responsible for all Content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when Content is posted by others who have accounts under your account).</p>
<p>One person or legal entity may not maintain more than one account.</p>
<p>You may not use the Software for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Software, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright laws).</p>
<p><strong>Payment, Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading Terms</strong></p>
<p>A valid credit card or PayPal account is required for paying accounts.</p>
<p>The Software is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.</p>
<p>For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, your credit card that you provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle.</p>
<p>Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account. We do not accept any liability for such loss.</p>
<p><strong>Beta Participation Agreement</strong></p>
<p>Please read and agree to the following terms and conditions, if you wish to be eligible to participate in the Closed Beta Testing for any of the new features that we will add to the JARVEE Software. </p>
<p>All BETA features and platforms will be clearly marked in the software with the term BETA</p>
<p>By Using the BETA FEATURES (like TikTok automation features, etc.) for FREE you acknowledge that they might not work as expected. We do our best to solve all problems via our support though so please be patient.</p>
<p>All BETA features are added as extra features, they are not part of our main product while in BETA. For that reason, if something marked as BETA is not working as intended you will not be eligible for a refund of the main product (Jarvee)</p>
<p><strong>Cancellation and Termination</strong></p>
<p>You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. An email or phone request to cancel your account is not considered cancellation. You can cancel your account at any time by clicking on provided cancellation link within your account.</p>
<p>If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will take effect immediately and you will not be charged again.</p>
<p>JARVEE, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Software, or any other JARVEE service, for any reason at any time. Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in your Account.
