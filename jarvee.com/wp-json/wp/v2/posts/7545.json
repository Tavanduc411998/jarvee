If you aren\u2019t using Reels for your business yet, you\u2019re missing out, big time. By using those 15-second videos, you could multiply your revenue multiple times over (<em>this piece tells you how<\/em>). <\/p>\n<p>Reels isn\u2019t just another \u201cfeature\u201d that Instagram rolled out. It isn\u2019t just a \u201cTikTok clone\u201d either. <\/p>\n<p>It has its own set of benefits. These aren\u2019t offered by the other features that Instagram offers.<\/p>\n<p>Now, you clearly know what Instagram Reels are (<em>why else would you be reading a piece on using Reels for marketing, right?<\/em>). <\/p>\n<p>However, you may not know these hidden benefits that Reels offers. So, let\u2019s start there?<\/p>\n<h2>Instagram Reels secrets for business (you didn\u2019t know)<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re asking \u201chow\u201d to leverage Reels, you also may need help with the \u201cwhy\u201d, right? There are more than a few answers to that.<\/p>\n<h2>Get on the train early<\/h2>\n<p>Instagram Reels just came out. That means, it\u2019s still in its \u201cearly adoption\u201d period.  What\u2019s that? Well, because it\u2019s new, Instagram wants more users to use it.  To promote the same, Instagram may boost the reach for Reels.<br \/>\nNow, there\u2019s no official statement from Instagram (<em>or Facebook, the Instagram parent company<\/em>) verifying the same.<\/p>\n<p>However, individuals and businesses alike have observed that Reels (<em>or, any other new Instagram feature<\/em>) gains more reach and exposure than older features.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, Reels actually resulted in more users signing up on Instagram. Just Indian downloads <a href=\"https:\/\/influencermarketinghub.com\/instagram-reels-stats\/#:~:text=Instagram%20averages%20100%20million%20daily,as%20of%20August%205%2C%202020.\">resulted in a 11.4% increase<\/a> in Instagram\u2019s overall downloads.  These new users downloaded Instagram for Reels, which means they\u2019ll engage and look for Reels actively, isn\u2019t that right?<\/p>\n<h2>Retarget your ads<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s also a more direct, marketable benefit that Reels offers as well. You can create video views custom audiences using Instagram Reels.<br \/>\nBasically, those users who interacted with your Reels can be re-targeted via ads. Now, this is something that neither Instagram Stories nor Instagram IGTV offers. This is why I mentioned earlier that Reels has brought in possibilities that other Instagram features do not offer.<br \/>\nDoes retargeting even work? Well, it\u2019s considered to be better than all other ad-placement and <a href=\"https:\/\/truelist.co\/blog\/retargeting-statistics\/#:~:text=Retargeting%20Statistics%20(Editor's%20Choice)&#038;text=Retargeting%20reduces%20cart%20abandonment%20by,with%20a%201%2C046%25%20efficiency%20rate.\">has a 1046% efficiency rate<\/a>.<br \/>\nSo, you may not get them to hit that \u201cbuy\u201d button just with your Reel. But, you sure will have a list of people who\u2019ll be much easier to convert with your ads.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, over 11% U.S Instagram users are already searching for and buying products on Instagram. Why not make them buy from you, right? (<em>If you keep reading, I\u2019ve shared how you can use Reels directly to increase your sales!<\/em>) <\/p>\n<h2>Everyone sees you (<em>even non-followers<\/em>)<\/h2>\n<p>Another reel benefit is that it appears in the Instagram \u201cExplore\u201d tab! Meaning, even those who do not follow you will get to see your Reel.<br \/>\nThis opens the floodgates for a much larger audience to you, doesn\u2019t it? Obviously, it would depend on how effective your Reel itself is when it comes to anyone actually paying attention to it.<\/p>\n<p>Again, not all of you may be impressed yet. Does anyone even care about the \u201cExplore\u201d tab? People mostly just stay on the feed, right? Well, not exactly.<\/p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/s21.q4cdn.com\/399680738\/files\/doc_financials\/2019\/Q2\/Q2'19-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf\">official Facebook quarterly reports<\/a>, 50%+ Instagram accounts use Reel every month! With its 1Billion+ user base, you can imagine the impact of potentially being visible to 500K people, at the least! <\/p>\n<h2>You stand a chance to get featured<\/h2>\n<p>This is rare, and not exactly a direct \u201cbenefit\u201d of using Reels. But, it still is a possibility that the other Instagram features do not offer!<br \/>\nYour Reels may sometimes be \u201cfeatured\u201d by Instagram on the explore page. If and when this happens, you\u2019ve officially gone viral. It\u2019s still more luck than work, but, a possibility nonetheless. <\/p>\n<h2>How to use Instagram Reels for Business? <\/h2>\n<p>So far, I\u2019ve just been talking about \u201cwhy\u201d you should start using Instagram Reels. But, I wouldn\u2019t leave you hanging. Let me help you with the \u201chow\u201d of using Instagram Reels for your business, right?<\/p>\n<h2>Educate your audience <\/h2>\n<p>This is true for most digital content. Why are you reading this post? Because, it\u2019s informative, right? Hopefully, you\u2019re learning at least something which wasn\u2019t known to you.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, using Reels to educate your audience is the best and most effective use for Reels. <\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a food-chain, restaurant, delivery app; why not post recipe Reels? Into the clothing industry? How about showing different ways to wear the same dress? There really is no limit to what you can do.<\/p>\n<h2>Promote your products <\/h2>\n<p>Instagram Reels are short, very short indeed. But, that\u2019s just the kind of content that users commit to these days, right? Not everyone fancies watching a 30-minute long video on their office desk.<\/p>\n<p>Hence, these 30-second long Reels are perfect for promoting your products! Show what you offer, what your competitors do not offer, and, why you\u2019re worth your viewers\u2019 business. <\/p>\n<p>We did some research and found Louis Vuitton making waves doing exactly this! Here are some of the Reels it posted:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/instagram-reels.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"599\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7555\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/instagram-reels.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/instagram-reels-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/instagram-reels-768x575.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/instagram-reels-600x449.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>(Image Source: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/louisvuitton\/Reels\/)<br \/>\nIf you\u2019re saying LV is going viral because it\u2019s already popular, you\u2019re wrong. Most of its normal \u201cvideos\u201d do not even cross the 300K mark in terms of views! While their Reels average 5 million views!<\/p>\n<h2>Use trending audio<\/h2>\n<p>How about using someone else\u2019s music, legally, for free, and it getting you millions of views? Reels offers that opportunity!<br \/>\nAs is public knowledge, Reels lets us add music to the videos, right? Now, users can discover Reels via the audio\/music in them. <\/p>\n<p>Hence, if you use a trending music\/audio (<em>e.g. The \u201cCoffin Dance\u201d meme audio<\/em>) chances are, users may discover your content by tapping on the music in someone else\u2019s Reels.<\/p>\n<h2>Let your customers market you<\/h2>\n<p>We can make a Reel saying \u2013\u201cHey, this is our product, go buy it.\u201d Guess what, no one buys.<\/p>\n<p>Or, you can ask your existing customers to send you videos of their feedback\/testimonials\/experiences\/reviews. <\/p>\n<p>You can then upload these to your account. Now, you got a video with absolutely no production cost. More importantly, the reviews will increase your brand\u2019s trust-factor and may lead to conversions. <\/p>\n<p>So, you just promoted yourself without making it seem like a promotion. Isn\u2019t that the best kind?<\/p>\n<h2>Put TikTok videos to use<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s face it, Reels and TikTok are basically the same thing. So, if you\u2019re the business I hope you are, you probably cashed in on TikTok as well?<br \/>\nHow about using those same videos also for your Instagram Reels? Video production is expensive and time-consuming.  But, not if you already have those videos, right?<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t need to import your entire TikTok library. Simply share your best-performing TikTok videos again on Reels! <\/p>\n<h2>Build trust (<em>and, a connection<\/em>)<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s 2020. No one just falls for \u201cads\u201d. You\u2019ve to be honest, transparent and \u201cactually worth it\u201d.  You can use Reels to do just that!<\/p>\n<p>Start sharing production videos, show them how things are done in your offices\/factories, maybe even share prank videos\/fun moments?<br \/>\nThe point is, you need to show your company\/business is \u201chuman\u201d and not just a money-making setup. <\/p>\n<h2>Prepare for the future <\/h2>\n<p>Instagram Reels doesn\u2019t have ads, for now. I\u2019m 100% certain that ads will be introduced for Reels in the (very) near future. <\/p>\n<p>So, create a team, today. Start working on those ad creatives. Do note that your standard banners and graphics won\u2019t work for Reels.<\/p>\n<p>Why not work on an ad idea starting today? At the least, prepare a rough checklist of what you\u2019ll do, and how. Trust me when I say this, most million-dollar companies have already started planning their Reels-ad strategies. <\/p>\n<p>By doing this, you can have your ads running in the first few hours of Instagram launching ads for Reels. Maximum visibility and conversions. Because, users wouldn\u2019t be used to skipping ads on Reels then!<\/p>\n<p>Worst \u2013case scenario? Instagram wouldn\u2019t introduce ads for Reels, you can still use these ideas for your video ads. No losses there.<\/p>\n<h2>Final words- Is Instagram Reels worth going after?<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019ll be honest, anything that\u2019s owned by Facebook is worth going after. You may, or may not like the company, but, they do own Facebook + Instagram + Whatsapp. The three horsemen of Gen-Z, right? They do have the biggest user-base on the planet (<em>literally<\/em>).<\/p>\n<p>Even though I\u2019ve shared why Reels are worth it, and how to capitalize on some of it; this is just a \u201cfraction\u201d of Reels\u2019 true potential. You can come up with a dozen other ideas on how to make Reels work for you.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram is such a mammoth algorithm, it\u2019s hard to sum it up in any number of words.
