Not only do more people visit your website through LinkedIn, but they\u2019re more likely to buy from you too.<\/p>\n<p>This social channel is especially useful for B2B businesses who may struggle finding leads on other social platforms. While users on Linkedin, they are in a business-focused mindset making this a great place for B2B brands to reach their target audience. But this doesn\u2019t mean this isn\u2019t a great place for B2C brands to market their services or product. Most B2C brands are extremely active on other social channels, making Linkedin less noisy and cluttered. This means a person is far more likely to see your B2C marketing-related content on this channel.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not <a href=\"https:\/\/www.elevationb2b.com\/blog\/use-linkedin-b2b-lead-generation\">leveraging the power of LinkedIn<\/a>, now\u2019s the time to do so.<\/p>\n<h2>Why LinkedIn?<\/h2>\n<p>Unlike Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, users on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/\">LinkedIn<\/a> are in work mode. It\u2019s a professional networking site that\u2019s geared towards promoting businesses, connecting with industry professionals, and finding top talent.<\/p>\n<p>This means that people using LinkedIn are in a certain mindset. They\u2019re not looking for funny videos of animals; they\u2019re on the hunt for professional information, products, and services.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, LinkedIn users are the most qualified leads you\u2019ll find on social media because they\u2019re in the right headspace to buy.<\/p>\n<p>The hard part is getting eyeballs on your LinkedIn posts and profile to encourage leads to convert. One of the most effective tactics for generating more views is to engage with other people\u2019s content on LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<p>Engagement is important for a number of reasons.<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, it helps you build <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-linkedin-live-can-help-your-company-grow\/\">connections<\/a> in your industry and, secondly, it boosts your visibility on the platform.<\/p>\n<h2>Think about it:<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re regularly engaging with top-name individuals in your industry and responding to LinkedIn posts with juicy nuggets of information, more people are going to come across your name.<\/p>\n<p>And, if you keep appearing with valuable advice and useful additions to the conversation, people are going to be inclined to click through to your site to see what you\u2019re all about.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/keep-appearing-with-valuable-advice-and-useful-additions.jpg\" alt=\"keep appearing with valuable advice and useful additions \" width=\"602\" height=\"365\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6815\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/keep-appearing-with-valuable-advice-and-useful-additions.jpg 602w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/keep-appearing-with-valuable-advice-and-useful-additions-300x182.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/keep-appearing-with-valuable-advice-and-useful-additions-600x364.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/keep-appearing-with-valuable-advice-and-useful-additions-480x290.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Essentially, <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/credible-tips-to-increase-instagram-engagement-during-quarantine\/\">engagement<\/a> leads to visibility. And, more people seeing your name across LinkedIn means more people to potentially convert into customers.<\/p>\n<p>Value is the key word here. Showing up and writing short, one-word comments that don\u2019t add to the conversation won\u2019t do much for your reputation. Instead, when you interact and engage with other people\u2019s content on LinkedIn, you should be looking to add value to the conversation.<\/p>\n<p>You probably see a lot of users in LinkedIn groups sharing short comments just to get their name out there and get themselves some visibility. But, while this might grab them a temporary dose of visibility, it\u2019s not a sustainable long-term strategy. One-word comments aren\u2019t going to be remembered by potential leads and customers. Instead, they\u2019re going to remember comments that were insightful and added something to the conversation.<\/p>\n<p>When you do the latter, you\u2019ll see an uptick in the number of conversions.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how engaging with other people\u2019s content on LinkedIn is the key to more conversions:<\/p>\n<h2>Engaging on LinkedIn Raises Awareness of Your Brand<\/h2>\n<p>The more you put your name out there in comments and conversations, the more people will come to know your name. If you\u2019re consistently showing up in relevant conversations, you\u2019re going to quickly raise awareness of your brand and ensure target customers remember who you are.<\/p>\n<p>This will help <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/social-media-content-strategy-basics\/\">keep your brand<\/a> front-of-mind so that when potential leads need a product or service like yours, you\u2019re going to be the first brand they think of.<\/p>\n<h2>Engaging on LinkedIn Helps Showcase Your Expertise <\/h2>\n<p>Customers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.business2community.com\/branding\/brand-trust-is-more-important-than-ever-for-consumers-02229321\">will only convert if they trust a brand<\/a>. They\u2019re not going to invest their money in someone or something they don\u2019t know much about and who hasn\u2019t proven themselves yet.<\/p>\n<p>This is why engaging on other people\u2019s content is so important. Adding valuable, insightful comments to posts and statuses will position you as an expert on your subject matter which, in turn, will increase trust levels with your audience and make it more likely that they\u2019ll convert.<\/p>\n<h2>Engaging on LinkedIn Builds Your Brand Reputation<\/h2>\n<p>The biggest brands seem to be everywhere on social media. This is because they work hard to build and maintain their solid reputation.<\/p>\n<p>Having a reputation like this &#8211; where customers are coming across your brand every single day in their feed &#8211; not only means leads are more likely to remember you when they need something you\u2019re offering, but also encourages more referrals.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.referralcandy.com\/blog\/word-of-mouth-marketing-strategy\/\">Word-of-mouth marketing is still one of the most powerful forms of marketing<\/a> and it\u2019s rife on social media. You\u2019ve probably been in a LinkedIn Group at some point and seen somebody ask recommendations for a product or a service provider.<\/p>\n<p>Most of the time the people or brands they tag are businesses that show up regularly in that group. They\u2019ve spent time nurturing relationships and building their reputation so that others feel comfortable recommending them to their colleagues and peers.<\/p>\n<h2>Engaging on LinkedIn Helps Nurture Customer Relationships <\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.globalbankingandfinance.com\/71-of-consumers-more-likely-to-buy-a-product-or-service-from-a-name-they-recognise\/#:~:text=The%20research%20by%20Onbuy.com,show%20that%20familiarity%20equals%20value.\">Customers are more likely to buy from brands they know and love<\/a>. Working on building strong customer relationships is a vital part of business, particularly if you want customers to keep coming back for more.<\/p>\n<p>Engaging on the posts of your customers and fellow industry professionals works to build solid relationships and show your human side. When you make yourself accessible like this, people are more likely to interact with you, start conversations, and check out what it is you\u2019re offering.<\/p>\n<h2>Increase Conversions on LinkedIn<\/h2>\n<p>LinkedIn is an incredibly powerful tool and should be a pivotal part of every brand\u2019s marketing strategy. When used correctly, it can be a huge traffic driver which, in turn, leads to more conversions.<\/p>\n<p>Make yourself known in relevant circles, join LinkedIn Groups filled with fellow industry professionals and potential customers, and get talking. This builds trust, establishes long-lasting relationships with potential leads, and puts your brand in front of so many more people.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the author<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Ryan-Gould-author.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan Gould author\" width=\"142\" height=\"143\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-6816\" \/>Ryan Gould, Vice President of Strategy and Marketing Services at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.elevationb2b.com\/\">http:\/\/www.elevationb2b.com\/<\/a>.
