But if you can quickly eliminate them, then you will be able to satisfy the client&#8217;s needs. To do this, you need to be present on the social network that your target audience uses.<br \/>\nHow to choose the right platform? It often happens that the owner of the company likes Facebook, and for this reason, the account is created there. But what if the brand sells socks with prints that are popular with Gen Z? Then other social networks are needed. The undisputed leader among <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ypulse.com\/article\/2020\/05\/06\/gen-z-millennials-5-favorite-social-media-platforms-now\/\">Generation Z is Instagram<\/a>. Snapchat, Youtube, and TikTok are also popular.<\/p>\n<p>It is necessary to choose a social network based on where your target audience is present. This is determined through research. For example, checking mentions of a company on social media. If you have a database of customer email addresses, you can do a survey. Add one question. Such a questionnaire will not puzzle the user, and the company will receive valuable information from the primary source.<\/p>\n<p>Ensure awareness by ensuring your presence on social media. To do this, you need a corporate identity that matches your brand concept. If you don&#8217;t already have it, then you need to <a href=\"http:\/\/zyro.com\/logo-maker\">create a logo<\/a>. This will help increase consumer confidence and promote properly on social media.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>#2 Set realistic expectations<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>This advice either seems obvious or meaningless. However, customer expectations must be constantly addressed. It is especially important to keep this in mind when creating ad content.<\/p>\n<p>By default, customers have no expectations. If the company delivers the order in three days, then they will not be upset. Another thing is when they promise to arrive a day in advance. Unreasonable expectations create negative user experiences. Therefore, before offering something, make sure that you are really able to guarantee it.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>#3 Listen<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Feedback from customers is useful information for the company. Therefore, be attentive to users. Do you have positive feedback on the product? See what you liked exactly: service, packaging, or product properties. This is your advantage. Did you find a negative review? Look at it as a message about an unmet need. Find it and suggest a solution. This is the brand growth area.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>#4 Answer quickly<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Imagine that the message comes from someone you love. We respond quickly, often and with enthusiasm to loved ones. The approach to communicating with clients should be the same. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.convinceandconvert.com\/social-media-research\/42-percent-of-consumers-complaining-in-social-media-expect-60-minute-response-time\/\">32% of users<\/a>, contacting a company via social networks, expect to receive a response within half an hour. 60 minutes &#8211; 42% of consumers wait.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, make sure that the specialists are always ready to answer the client.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the speed of responses should not negatively affect their quality. Provide clients with real information and operate with facts. If a person has difficulties, be sure to offer him a solution.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>#5 Track company mentions<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>They can be found in the form of reviews, product reviews, user-generated content, and more. The easiest way to track is by looking at posts where a brand has been tagged. You can also monitor posts by hashtags.<\/p>\n<p>However, there is an important point &#8211; users are sealed. Especially if the brand is new. It&#8217;s a pity, but people sometimes remember the names poorly and make mistakes in the hashtag. Consider this also.<\/p>\n<p>You can track mentions manually. However, it will take a long time. To monitor mentions regularly and not reduce the quality of other tasks, it is worth automating the process. For example, through the use of special tools.<\/p>\n<p>They will track any mentions of the brand offline. Some services take into account possible typos. For example, HootSuite. The tool is able to independently track them and add them to the database.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>#6 Use an appropriate tone of voice<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Nobody likes arrogant people. It is also unpleasant when you are treated like a fool. Both situations are a consequence of the inappropriate tone of voice. To prevent this, it is important to define it correctly.<br \/>\nCommunication tone is a collection of speech tools used by a company in the process of communicating with a client. This includes terms, slang, and style of speech. Together, they allow you to communicate with the client in a manner familiar to him.<br \/>\nFor example, the average consumer won&#8217;t like using a lot of terms. However, it is valuable in the B2B marketplace.<br \/>\nThe tone in which you communicate with the customer is extremely important to the quality of the service. Therefore, special attention is paid to some cases:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>What slang do customers use?<\/li>\n<li>Do they tend to use emojis, exclamation marks, etc.?<\/li>\n<li>Does the communication take place in the client&#8217;s native language or is the level of proficiency lower?<\/li>\n<li>How does the client communicate when upset, and what is the best way to express empathy?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The tone of communication should be based on the characteristics of the speech of the target audience. It is that you should rely on it. By tailoring your tone to your customers, you will achieve better communication and customer satisfaction. Therefore, even eliminating unpleasant situations will become easier.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>#7 Minimize the human factor<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Employees are, first of all, people. They happen to have bad days. It is worth taking care that such circumstances do not affect communication with clients. To do this, develop rules for social networks.<\/p>\n<p>Provides guidelines for customer support managers. A simple set of rules based on company values guarantees the consistent quality of service. Recommendations may include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Communication tone.<\/li>\n<li>Response time.<\/li>\n<li>Scripts for answers to common questions.<\/li>\n<li>Scenario for resolving problems and conflict situations.<\/li>\n<li>Permissions management system.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Customer support on social networks is not much different from the usual one. It also requires responsiveness, meeting user needs, and finding the most comfortable communication style. The only thing that matters on social media is accuracy. The company must understand where its customers are, why they are on these platforms and how communication occurs here. Strive to understand your user, and they will respond favorably to you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Customer service is an integral part of communication.
