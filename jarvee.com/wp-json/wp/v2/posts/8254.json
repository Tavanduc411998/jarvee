Business owners and entrepreneurs see it differently. As far as they are concerned, it\u2019s nothing more than a marketing tool and a means to an end (get new customers and drive sales).<br \/>\nIf you fall into this category, you probably have a small business or startup that you are pushing on your own, and you are looking to adopt social media as a <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-create-social-media-marketing-plan-from-scratch\/\">marketing strategy<\/a> to grow your startup.<\/p>\n<p>Irrespective of what stage you are in with your startup or how much you have grown, you will always need social media to reach more people and make more sales. If you don\u2019t know how to use social media for your startup, here are few tips that will help you.<\/p>\n<h2>Have a strong social media profile<\/h2>\n<p>Your social media profile is what your audience will check out once they find you on any social media network. You must create strong and convincing profiles on the different platforms you are on. It means that you have to fill in various details, but it is worth it in the end. The more information you put out about you, the more your audiences know and become drawn to you.<br \/>\nYour profile must include a link to your website (where you can add the link). This can help you drive organic traffic for your website and get you more leads.<\/p>\n<h2>Create and share unique, high-quality content<\/h2>\n<p>Content marketing is a significant part of your social media marketing strategy. According to content creators at different help services, there are different types of content that you can create and share on social media platforms. This includes blog posts, videos, infographics, podcasts, presentations, etc.<br \/>\nYour post&#8217;s kind of content will depend on factors such as the product\/service you render, your industry, and the type of audience. Not all content types are appropriate for all audiences. Once you\u2019ve determined the appropriate content type for your startup, the next step is to create high-quality content for your audience.<br \/>\nNote that you will have to find a successful content marketing strategy to find the balance between what your audience needs\/want to hear and the message you want to convey.<\/p>\n<h2>Be consistent<\/h2>\n<p>Consistency is how to grow your startup on social media and maintains its relevance with its followers. While you create unique and high-quality content, it will be less effective if you are not consistent with it. There is too much information on social media that cuts across your audience\u2019s feed, as well as other startups trying to target them. The only way to remain on their mind is by being on their face regularly through consistent posting. If you&#8217;re unable to maintain a certain level of consistency, then you\u2019re likely to fade out quickly on social media.<\/p>\n<h2>Engage with your audience<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.omnikick.com\/increase-social-media-engagement\/\">Engaging with your audience<\/a> and followers on social media helps to build a stronger connection with them. So, if you have made a post that they have liked and commented on, even shared, you should interact with them by replying to their comments or reposting it. This bridges the gap between the brand and the prospects\/customers. You could also come across some of their posts as well, like them, and comment on them. This interaction endears the brand to the target market.<br \/>\nBy being active on social media, you can easily get feedback and direct answers about you and your startup.<\/p>\n<h2>Cross-promote your social media accounts<\/h2>\n<p>Once you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/253858\">build your audience<\/a> or number of followers up to a considerable amount on one platform, you can cross-promote your other social media accounts. It doesn\u2019t have to be something massive; a small, simple post will do it. For instance, if you are on Twitter and want to cross-promote your Instagram account, you can make a simple tweet saying: \u201cFollow our Instagram page.\u201d That\u2019s all. This is an effective strategy as some of your Twitter audience will follow you and repost your content on Instagram and other platforms. Consequently, your startup&#8217;s visibility on social media will increase.<\/p>\n<h2>Use Hashtags<\/h2>\n<p>The hashtag is a real thing on different social media networks. When you post something on social media, you should include a hashtag to it. The hashtag increases your visibility on social media. Once someone searches for that hashtag on the platform, it brings out all the posts that used that same hashtag (including yours) and shows them to the searcher. This makes it easy for many people to find you, go through your profile.<\/p>\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8255 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/best-time-to-post.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/best-time-to-post.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/best-time-to-post-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/best-time-to-post-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/best-time-to-post-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/h2>\n<h2>Post your content at the optimal time<\/h2>\n<p>Since you have a target audience, then you have to know your audience. One thing you have to pay attention to is what time your audience is available online and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oberlo.com\/blog\/best-time-post-social-media\">when is the best time to post on each social media platform<\/a>. Once you know this, you know you have to post your content at that time to reach them quickly. This will ensure that your post is more visible to them.<\/p>\n<p>As a brand that wants to be successful on social media, you can\u2019t decide what time to post your content on your own. It has to be dependent on your audience. For instance, posting important content by 10 am, when your audiences are the working-class group, is inappropriate. This is an expressway to getting little to no engagements. This is because your audiences are busy at work at the time and are unlikely to be off social media at the time. The probability that they will find such a post by 8 pm when they are at home, relaxed, and ready to scroll through their feed is very low. If your audience cannot like, comment, and share your posts, you can\u2019t grow on social media.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Even there are many different approaches to using social media to grow your startup, there is no one optimal solution that will work for all. These are just a few of the tips that you can adopt. The best way to see what will work best for you is to try different methods and see what will bring you the results that you are looking for.<\/p>\n<h2>Author\u2019s Bio:<\/h2>\n<p>Susanna Balashova is a creative magician in a world of (mostly) boring Marketing.
