Using More Video Ads in Marketing<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/99firms.com\/blog\/facebook-video-statistics\/#gref\">More than 4 billion people<\/a> watch videos on Facebook every day, with 65% being mobile users.<\/p>\n<p>A study conducted by Hubspot indicates that most people (about 62%) pay thorough attention to video content as compared to written or audio content. And <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/larry-kim\/visual-content-marketing-16-eye-popping-statistics-you-need-to-know.html\">85%<\/a> of these audiences are likely to purchase a product after viewing the video ads.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7438\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Using-More-Video-Ads-in-Marketing.jpg\" alt=\"Using More Video Ads in Marketing\" width=\"592\" height=\"276\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Using-More-Video-Ads-in-Marketing.jpg 592w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Using-More-Video-Ads-in-Marketing-300x140.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>No doubt.

Remember, the higher the engaged audience, the more likely to achieve higher sales for your products.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7439\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Facebook-live-videos-generate-triple-watch-time.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook live videos generate triple watch time\" width=\"538\" height=\"171\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Facebook-live-videos-generate-triple-watch-time.jpg 538w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Facebook-live-videos-generate-triple-watch-time-300x95.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But now, how can you create an engaging Facebook video ad? An ad that your audience can never ignore \u2013 a must-watch video ad.<\/p>\n<p>Here are your killer tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Have a clear purpose for your video ad:<\/strong> What&#8217;s the purpose of your video ad?

Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/web.facebook.com\/business\/news\/lead-ads-launch?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr\">lead ads<\/a> are your amazing solution.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>HACK #4. Post at The Right Time<\/h2>\n<p>Get this fact right. Creating engaging and robust marketing content on Facebook is not final. It doesn&#8217;t guarantee traffic.<\/p>\n<p>The question is, what&#8217;s the right time to post your marketing content? Don&#8217;t forget that your traffic reciprocates to your leads and eventually sales.<\/p>\n<p>First, who is your audience? And second, what&#8217;s their favorite time to read your posts?<\/p>\n<p>Knowing and understanding your audience is the key to reaching them. Imagine creating marketing content, and it fails to reach your targeted audience \u2013 just because your timing is wrong.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7440\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Post-at-The-Right-Time.jpg\" alt=\"Post at The Right Time\" width=\"626\" height=\"91\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Post-at-The-Right-Time.jpg 626w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Post-at-The-Right-Time-300x44.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Post-at-The-Right-Time-600x87.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/buffer.com\/library\/best-time-to-post-on-facebook\/#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20Buffer%20study,during%20the%20week%20and%20Saturdays.\">Study reports at Buffer<\/a>, indicates that posting Facebook content between 1 pm to 3 pm is a gateway to reaching a massive audience \u2013 especially on weekdays and on Saturdays. And in terms of the best days of the week to make your posts, Thursday and Friday stand out to be peak days.<\/p>\n<p>However, different authors have specific times and days when their posts are likely to reach many audiences.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>According to SocialPilot, posts made between 9 pm to 11 pm perform better.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7441\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/posts-made-between-9-pm-to-11-pm-perform-better.jpg\" alt=\"posts made between 9 pm to 11 pm perform better\" width=\"340\" height=\"105\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/posts-made-between-9-pm-to-11-pm-perform-better.jpg 340w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/posts-made-between-9-pm-to-11-pm-perform-better-300x93.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/trackmaven.com\/blog\/best-times-to-post-social-media\/\">TrackMaven<\/a> prefers making posts on Thursdays at 8 pm.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/coschedule.com\/blog\/best-times-to-post-on-social-media\/#facebook\">CoSchedule<\/a> prefers posting from 1 pm to 4 pm<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Guess what?
