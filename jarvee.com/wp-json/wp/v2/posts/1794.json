it can do for your account and if it is worth the trouble.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1796\"

the word \u201cpod\u201d, depending on when you were born, you might probably associate it with peas, beans, detachable spacecraft or even dolphins.\u00a0 Well, we might have a different \u201cfirst thing that comes to mind\u201d answers, but there is a common factor in it, they all come in groups and functions as a support system.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram comment pods are like your circle of friends on the said platform who guaranteed to always like and comment on your posts regardless of whatever you put up there.\u00a0 It is pretty much like a bot, if you ask me, only with real people doing the action or at least that is how you ideally thought it should be.<\/p>\n<h3>How Does It Operate?<\/h3>\n<p>The way it is setup is not that complicated.\u00a0 Each Instagram comment pod can have around 10 to 20 Instagram users who are in the same niche.\u00a0 They inform each other of the new post they published through their chat group.<\/p>\n<p>It does not really matter where they privately do the announcement, as long as the information gets disseminated to all members of the pod, then it is all good.\u00a0 It could be an exclusive chat group on Facebook, Instagram or any other messaging app.<\/p>\n<p>Once the user gets the message, they jump into action by commenting on the post.\u00a0 They can also throw a couple of likes while they are at it to give more engagement boost.\u00a0 Thus, it is a collective work and if it does execute as planned, each member could expect to benefit from it.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1797\" src=\"http:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/collaborative-effort.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"510\" height=\"339\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/collaborative-effort.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/collaborative-effort-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/collaborative-effort-600x399.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Collaborative Effort \u2013 What To Gain?<\/h3>\n<p>By theory, Instagram comment pods should help each participating members receive a decent amount of action or engagement on their post as soon as it gets published.\u00a0 This tactic is thought to increase the likelihood of the post\u2019s chance in getting selected for Instagram Explore page.<\/p>\n<p>If the post gets featured on the Explore page of Instagram, it gets a better exposure that will result in a higher probability of gaining new followers.\u00a0 Aside from that, receiving comments and likes from other known or influential presence makes a nice impression to regular users.<\/p>\n<h3>Are There Any House Rules?<\/h3>\n<p>Depending on the pod members, they can generate and impose their own policies.\u00a0 Having a set of guidelines is advantageous as it can make the interaction look sincere and not obligatory.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some good ones to observe should you create or join Instagram comment pods.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Give quality comments.\u00a0 It should be relevant ones and not just some gibberish one or two liners.<\/li>\n<li>The comments should not be wishy-washy like \u201cthat is nice\u201d, \u201clooks awesome\u201d and anything similar to that effect.<\/li>\n<li>No \u201cemoji\u201d comments.\u00a0 It is lazy and to be honest, robotic.<\/li>\n<li>Add some bit of personal touch, address the person who published the post and tag the user in your comment.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure that everyone in the pod understands what \u201cgive and take\u201d means, in the real sense of it for that matter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>How to Join the Pods?<\/h3>\n<p>Being accepted in the pod is a rather tricky aspect.\u00a0 While some are very out there and actively advertising their pods, others are somewhat mum about it.\u00a0 On Twitter alone, you\u2019ll be able to spot those who are openly promoting and inviting members to their pods.<\/p>\n<p>However, the bigger question is if those engagement groups are the Instagram comment pods that are appropriate for your account. \u00a0Thus, you\u2019ll need to do some homework on this part, check the niche and perhaps observe the engagement between the participants.<\/p>\n<p>If you can\u2019t find a suitable pod for you, then you can just go ahead and create one for yourself.\u00a0 You can test it out with a couple of social media marketer friends you know who are operating within the same niche or at least a relevant one.<\/p>\n<h3>What\u2019s The Downside?<\/h3>\n<h3>Non-stop Notifications<\/h3>\n<p>Imagine receiving a phone call every 5 minutes or so or someone spamming your phone, you will definitely switch your phone off because it is annoying.\u00a0 And just like that, the flood of notifications you will receive whenever a pod member publishes their post can be overwhelming.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-1798 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Non-stop-Notifications.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\"

perhaps anticipated, that some pod members would soon become bored and just throw in comments that are a bit off.\u00a0 As humans, we all tend to lose interest on something that we are asked to do over and over again.<\/p>\n<h3>Minimal Conversion<\/h3>\n<p>Good engagement does not always mean an increase in conversion.\u00a0 This is especially true if you are using Instagram for your shop.\u00a0 While your pods are actively commenting and liking your posts, there is no guarantee that a sale could come from it.<\/p>\n<h3>No Satisfaction<\/h3>\n<p>Alternatives are available all the time.\u00a0 It can provide temporary satisfaction but in the end, you will still have your eyes set on what is authentic and truly valuable.<\/p>\n<h3>Final Thoughts\u00a0<img loading=\"lazy\"
