The world\u2019s most visual social media platform, with an impressive growing presence worldwide, Pinterest is a goldmine for brands because it\u2019s a place where consumers hunt and gather.<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/images.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1003\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1337\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/images.jpeg 1500w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/images-300x201.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/images-768x514.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/images-1024x685.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/images-600x401.jpeg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" \/><br \/>\nWhile Facebook and Twitter could be sending nice traffic to your blog, Pinterest may be taking all of your prospective readers. Tweets and posts have short lifespans but a pin will be repinned tomorrow, next week, next month, and even next year! If you are not leveraging Pinterest, get active now! <\/p>\n<p>Use these tips to drive more traffic to your blog.<\/p>\n<h3>#1 Create Original Content<\/h3>\n<p>The most important decision you have to make when pinning is choosing images. More than 80% of pins on Pinterest are repins. This means that if you repin other people\u2019s content, you won\u2019t get anywhere. However, if you create your own content, you get a lot of exposure as you have a mass of people waiting to circulate your pins. <\/p>\n<p>Creating original images is beneficial as you can use them on other social media channels to improve click-through rates. You can create an image, video, or an infographic. Always remember these 4 things when creating your own content:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose vertical images \u2013 all pins on Pinterest have the same width, focus on the length to create standout images<\/li>\n<li>Stick to your blog\u2019s visual identity \u2013 Use the same color scheme or fonts that are on your blog<\/li>\n<li>Embrace bright and bold colors \u2013 these will capture people\u2019s attention<\/li>\n<li>Be sure to add a link to each pin to ensure people are directed to your blog when they click on it. If you don\u2019t add links, you\u2019ll get zero traffic. Pinterest usually adds dead links to pins without links. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-pins.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3563\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-pins.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-pins-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-pins-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-pins-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>#2 Add Descriptions to Your Pins<\/h3>\n<p>The description is set under the pinned image and gives additional information about it. It is very important as it gives you a chance to tell people what your blog post is about. It also appears each time a person repins the pin. <\/p>\n<p>Use concise and appealing wording that reflects your blog post\u2019s content. Even if your images have text, add a description. People search for pins using keywords and if yours don\u2019t have descriptions, they won\u2019t appear in the results. <\/p>\n<p>In your description, cover the following elements:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell people why they should read further<\/li>\n<li>Incorporate keywords relevant to the blog post<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t reveal everything to entice people to read more<\/li>\n<li>Make it short and simple<\/li>\n<li>You can add hashtags and a web address<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>#3 Hold a Contest<\/h3>\n<p>Many companies have driven traffic to their websites simply by holding contests on Pinterest. To make sure you attain the same results, hold a contest where contestants must pin content from your blog or repin your existing pins that link back to your site. <\/p>\n<p>The most important thing is to ensure people share pins that promote your blog. The winner should be the person who has given you the most exposure. <\/p>\n<p>For example, you can pick someone whose pin has been repinned many times over or someone whose board has a high number of followers. When creating a contest, look at how popular brands on Pinterest do it.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-boards.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"750\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3562\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-boards.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-boards-300x281.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-boards-768x720.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-boards-600x563.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>#4 Create a Board<\/h3>\n<p>Creating a board on Pinterest is of utmost importance. You should have one main board for your blog. When you create too many boards, some people might follow individual boards and ignore the \u201cfollow all\u201d button. <\/p>\n<p>Make it easy for people to find your blog posts and to follow your blog. Also, add a category to your board to ensure your pins appear in the category. This way, even those who don\u2019t follow you will see your pins when they search in that category. <\/p>\n<p>Give your blog board the same name as your blog. You can also add keywords if you want your board to show up on search engines.<\/p>\n<h3>#5 Join Popular Group Boards in Your Industry<\/h3>\n<p>Another way to get more traffic through Pinterest is by contributing to group boards. Popular group boards have many loyal followers and can generate a lot of traffic to your blog. <\/p>\n<p>Set aside some time to find popular boards in your industry and like, repin, and comment on their pins. Afterward, request their owners to add you as a contributor. Once you are added, start contributing content from your blog and from other people\u2019s blogs. When you share your content on popular boards, you connect with a bigger segment of your ideal audience. <\/p>\n<h3>#6 Concentrate on Trending Topics<\/h3>\n<p>This technique is highly underutilized by most bloggers. Why post pins people will never open? If you want your pins to enjoy a high click-through rate, focus on trending topics. Relate your content, services, and products to current events. For example, you can create a Christmas Gift Ideas board and fill it with your company\u2019s products. Write blog posts that relate to trends or conditions in your industry. Always research what is hot in your industry prior to writing. <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-search.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3568\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-search.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-search-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-search-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/pinterest-search-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>#7 Engage with Your Followers<\/h3>\n<p>As with any other social network, engagement is vital on Pinterest. When you engage with people, you turn them from pinners into readers. <\/p>\n<p>Engage with your followers and they will connect with you on your blog as well as other sites. There are numerous ways you can engage on Pinterest. You can repin your followers\u2019 pins, follow them, ask questions, and offer solutions.<\/p>\n<h3>#8 Add a Call to Action<\/h3>\n<p>One thing you should never forget is that the powerful marketing strategies that work on other social networks also work on Pinterest. For instance, a call to action can increase the engagement of a pin by 80%. After adding a description to a pin, ask people to click on the link, to like the pin, to repin, or to leave a comment. Don\u2019t wait for them to figure out the action you want them to take, tell them!<\/p>\n<h3>Wrapping Things Up<\/h3>\n<p>Pinterest is a great platform for generating new blog readers. However, most marketers and entrepreneurs see it as a hub for food bloggers and DIY enthusiasts. Far from it! A site is a tool any blogger can use to increase their reach online and grow their blog. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With more than 175 million monthly active users, Pinterest is a force to reckon with.
