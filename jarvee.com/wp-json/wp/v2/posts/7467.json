Keep reading to discover 7 ways how AI-powered systems can improve your marketing strategy.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The number of AI startups since 2000 has increased <a href=\"https:\/\/techjury.net\/blog\/ai-statistics\/#gref\">14 times<\/a>. AI capacity continues to grow, encompassing more industries where it can make a difference. One of the latest trends in AI application is AI in digital marketing. Its role here is to stimulate customers to make a purchase, which is delivered by transforming their indifference to a desire for one or another product or service. This area of marketing is called stimulation marketing, and it is the foundation for high sales volumes and consistent brand growth.<\/p>\n<p>If it is one of your long-term business goals, let\u2019s look into the rising trends in AI-based digital marketing that will prevail in businesses across all sectors in the coming years.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7470\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Top-Ways-How-Artificial-Intelligence-Helps-Businesses.jpg\" alt=\"Top Ways How Artificial Intelligence Helps Businesses\" width=\"624\" height=\"417\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Top-Ways-How-Artificial-Intelligence-Helps-Businesses.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Top-Ways-How-Artificial-Intelligence-Helps-Businesses-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/Top-Ways-How-Artificial-Intelligence-Helps-Businesses-600x401.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Top Ways How Artificial Intelligence Helps Businesses<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> AI-based Content Management<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>AI-generated content will be predominantly used for SEO purposes where machine intelligence is no inferior to human input as some aspects of SEO content are oriented rather on keywords and structure than meaning. Machine-driven content is becoming more in demand in the field of email marketing, reporting, and social media too. ML algorithms will be actively used for content generation to be posted on eCommerce websites, sports news, and real-time stock market updates where a large part of content is mostly data-driven, for example, statistics, metrics, and forecasts. AI-generated systems will let you produce automated content, so making more time to devote to more creative activities that have a bigger impact on the customer attitude towards your brand.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> Customer Behavior Analysis<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>AI can give you insights into where to look for potential customers. Today, ML and AI algorithms are used to process billions of data, including geo-data, demographic factors, user search history, etc. This data analysis results in detailed buyer personas that are needed to come up with the right targeting strategy. AI-powered customer behavior analysis is recommended to every company that relies on real-time data-driven decisions in their digital marketing campaigns. With the help of AI, you will be able to predict the churn rate and keep track of the level of customer engagement being changed in proportion to the factors stimulating the buying behavior.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> AI-Enhanced Digital Advertising<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Digital advertising is now largely implemented through Google and Facebook Ads. Both tech giants build on AI to create user profiles for digital ad campaigns in which a customer is displayed the products he or she checked or searched before. The use of AI algorithms will allow for even more accurate matching and automation as a result of which a prospect will be offered the product or service that ideally fits with their expectations. Thus, AI-powered systems are used to optimize advertising channels in a way that brings the right audience to a brand or company paying for ads.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong> Chatbots<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>AI-driven chatbots are the number-one trend in eCommerce employed in many <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.inymbus.com\/top-6-benefits-of-robotics-in-deductions-and-chargebacks\">business processes<\/a>, including digital marketing. They often play a dominant role in converting a user into a prospect by establishing customer interest in one or another product. Advanced chatbots are designed to recognize speech queries and fully substitute human agents involved with customer support and service. The key value of chatbots, though, is that their ability to deal with customer discontent is superior to what you can observe in human interactions. Besides extreme speed and infallibility, a smart chatbot lets you improve the level of customer satisfaction and increase customer engagement.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong> Personalized Website Experience<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Smart algorithms backed by AI can be also applied to improve a website experience and conversion rate. Plenty of global media resources like the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, and People use web push notifications to engage passive readers. Moreover, AI does not just send random messages but personalized notifications with references to posts or information that can be potentially interesting to the user. Business and eCommerce websites can harness AI capacity, in this case, to tailor web recommendations to their prospect\u2019s wishes and preferences. As a result, intelligent marketing reduces the need for human consultants that will advise and support customers in their buying journeys.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong> Increased ROI<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The use of <a href=\"https:\/\/computools.com\/artificial-intelligence\/\">Artificial intelligence in business<\/a> is above all connected to automation that eliminates repetitive and manual work and gives time for more complex and thought-provoking tasks. AI-based automation is typically characterized by the following positive changes in business: cost savings, faster decision-making, better risk-management, less potential of human error. However, the biggest upside to employing AI solutions is increased ROI. Since you reduce your labor costs and can control the majority of business risks, AI allows you to achieve higher revenue in the first fiscal quarter after its implementation. Similarly, you can use AI-driven systems to run return-on-investment advertising campaigns intended to attract more paying customers and stimulate them to make an order on your website.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong> Automated image recognition<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Text search will become outdated soon. Today, more online retailers support voice search that allows customers to navigate websites faster. Voice commands are far superior to ordinary texting as it takes less time and effort to send a query to a machine. Voice-based search is a killer feature of Echo Dot and Google Mini, both using virtual assistants to interact with users via voice messages. However, the next step in customer service is image recognition that will let consumers automatically detect the right item among a thousand pieces of content on a web page. Pinterest and Facebook already started using AI-powered image and video recognition. Facial recognition software is now employed in <a href=\"https:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/2017\/08\/marketers-use-artificial-intelligence\/\">59% of U.K. fashion stores<\/a> that welcome customers with discounts and push notifications as soon as they enter a shop. This type of stimulation will result in automated customer interactions that take place with the help of AI.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What are the most common challenges of using AI in digital marketing?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Stimulation marketing opens up new avenues for SME and big corporations, but there are a number of issues to consider before adopting AI marketing solutions. These are the difficulties in maintaining AI-powered systems integrated with the marketing processes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Privacy<\/strong>. AI programs require complying with privacy standards and specific legal guidelines such as GDPR aimed to ensure customer data security and protection.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Data quantity<\/strong>. AI marketing software is designed to process massive data volumes coming from user activity on a website or eCommerce platform. Data collection and analysis should be managed by competent specialists such as a data scientist that you will need to recruit to your team.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Deployment<\/strong>. AI-driven campaigns are extremely efficient but can be also costly if you have never used this type of software. You will have to invest in AI tools as well as learn your team how to leverage them correctly and to the best advantage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the author:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-7471\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/My-profile-photo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" \/>Kyle McDermott is a web developer, blogger, blockchain enthusiast, and business analyst.
