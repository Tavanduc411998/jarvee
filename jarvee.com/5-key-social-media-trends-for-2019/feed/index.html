The strategy for private and public accounts are absolutely same, although you might have lower follow back rate with private account because potential followers don&#039;t see your content and that might be crucial when they&#039;re deciding will they following you or not.

Regarding contact form, we just tested it, it works fine on our side... What error message you get?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello, Iâ€™d like to know if I can grow up my followers using jarvee if I had a private account ?

Sorry to put my question here but itâ€™s impossible to use your contact form.

Thank in advance for your reply.

Best regards
