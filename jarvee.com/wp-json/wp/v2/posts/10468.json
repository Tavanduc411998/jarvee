Especially with so many people working from home within a globalized economy, without supportive communication throughout your business, you will find productivity and efficiency declining. A lack of communication can lead to a lack of customer satisfaction and business growth.<\/p>\n<p>With technology advancing by leaps and bounds, there is any number of communications options that will allow your business to flourish through utilizing innovative and creative communications throughout the different chapters and branches of your business.<\/p>\n<h2>Communication is Key for Multiple Reasons<\/h2>\n<p>We have all heard the term communication is key to\u2026 however, what does this mean? Is it clear communication between workers and higher-level management? Communication between workers? Communication between different branches of a business? Communication with customers? What does communication even mean in terms of business growth and development? Well, ALL OF IT matters!<\/p>\n<h3>Communication Between Management and Workers<\/h3>\n<p>For many businesses, there will be differing office locations, with workers focusing more on the outside business and customer service. Management offices are normally centralized within one area, while workers are located in other areas. Even if these departments are not located in the same area, it is incredibly important to remain connected.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10470\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Communication-Between-Management-and-Workers.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"371\" height=\"518\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Communication-Between-Management-and-Workers.png 371w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Communication-Between-Management-and-Workers-215x300.png 215w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Management is in charge of watching the numbers, driving goals, and handling training. If management does not have a clear and easy way of effectively connecting with their differing workers and locations, then this can lead to a breakdown of regulations and operating ideals.<\/p>\n<p>Differing branches of the same company should still have the same goals, training, and operating procedures, no matter how far apart they may be. That means that having open and reliable communication between all levels of business is important to ensuring everyone within the company is on the same page. Having differing branches of the same company operating in clearly different ways can lead to disaster within a corporation or small business, so it is important to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/business\/learn\/types-of-business-communication\/\">maintain open communication<\/a> for tracking and training purposes.<\/p>\n<h3>Communication in Office Between Workers<\/h3>\n<p>Office settings can be tricky when it comes to communication. You might think it is as easy as walking to a coworker\u2019s desk and having a chat, but communication isn&#8217;t always that easy. Having a streamlined method of communicating between workers, such as an instant messaging or information sharing platform can be incredibly beneficial to any company. Record keeping and communication go hand in hand. If there are multiple workers in your office, but their client files are stored locally, without specific notes, it can be difficult for supervisors or other workers to help clients if the person with their files is busy or not in the office.<\/p>\n<p>Having a linked and integrated system that allows workers to share notes, information, and ask questions while they are with clients can make a huge difference. Companies such as <a href=\"https:\/\/saicom.io\/\">Saicom<\/a> provide intuitive and innovative options for businesses to remain in contact and have a shared network of information. If workers struggle to stay on the same page, this can look bad and inconvenience customers, leading to loss of customer satisfaction. Ensuring all workers can communicate rapidly and efficiently means a stronger capacity for efficiency and productivity.<\/p>\n<h3>Communication Between Branches<\/h3>\n<p>Digital communication between office branches is vital to maintaining consistency throughout your brand and business. While different branches may have their methods for certain office administration, when it comes down to the bottom line, all your branches should be running in the same manner, with the same technology. This ensures that your business presents a strong front from all areas, allowing for efficiency in its daily operations.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10469\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Communication-Between-Branches.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"312\" height=\"469\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Communication-Between-Branches.png 312w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Communication-Between-Branches-200x300.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Technology is incredibly important when it comes to managing multiple branches, and ensuring that all your branches have access to the same connectivity, software, and client files is important to customer service and business growth. If a client is in another location, and they are unable to access their files and information, this can impede employees when trying to serve the client. For every unhappy client who cannot be served efficiently and have their situation dealt with, that impedes business growth. Communication is not just phone calls, it is the intrinsic networking ability of your company. In a global marketplace where technological advancement is key, be sure that all your locations have access to the best technology to increase efficiency, productivity, customer service, and satisfaction.<\/p>\n<h3>Communications With Customers<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-unified-communications-helps-manage-customer-relationships\/\">Communicating with customers<\/a> is more than just having a customer service phone number. Remaining in contact with your customer, offering new services to previous customers, and ensuring the highest level of service to your customers is all part of your business communications strategy. Ensuring that you stay in contact with your clients, advising them of your newest products and services, or checking in after a service has been provided is all incredibly important.<\/p>\n<p>In the past the majority of these communications have needed a customer service representative, but with today&#8217;s technology that is no longer the case. Using effective communications software to network with your clients, send automated emails or text messages, and do routinely automated follow-ups can free up your employee\u2019s time to attract new leads and business. It also leaves your employees free to deal with any concerns or problems that may arise with customer complaints or issues. Having your workers free to deal with customers on a one-on-one basis and resolve any issues can make your business soar and reduce their stress load, leading to happier clients and more efficient workers.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10471\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Communications-With-Customers.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"381\" height=\"570\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Communications-With-Customers.png 381w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Communications-With-Customers-201x300.png 201w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>No matter how you break it down, communication is key to any business\u2019s success and advancement. Ensuring that all aspects of your communications network are top-notch and en pointe can alleviate so many issues within the workplace. With multiple options available for businesses to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.indeed.com\/career-advice\/career-development\/importance-of-business-communication\">improve their communication network<\/a>, there is no reason you can&#8217;t take that first step within your business. Without solid communication, your business will not reach the heights that it otherwise could. Ensuring your communications strategies and networks are strong and up to date can make a huge difference for your business.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Author<\/h3>\n<p>Danielle Faye is a strategic communication specialist.
