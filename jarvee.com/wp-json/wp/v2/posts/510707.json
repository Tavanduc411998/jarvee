To get higher rankings for your website among others on the search engine results page, you have to make sure that it is search engine friendly. This type of website is easily read by search engines and provides ease of access for users also. Your website should be fast and functional and consist of unique and quality content for a user-friendly experience. SEO is of two types:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On-page SEO<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-page SEO<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On-Page SEO<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It contains things that help the search engines to know what your page is all about. Using specific keywords for your website can help search engines in doing that. On the page, SEO inculcates optimizing the standards of the visible content on your website to generate more qualified traffic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Page SEO<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It refers to all those things done outside your website but helps improve your search engine results page ranking. It is a powerful and effective tool to get your site a higher rank on the search engines. It involves many practices like link building, social media marketing, etc to generate more traffic for your website. Some industry experts are of the view that off-page Search Engine Optimization is even more important than on-page SEO.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GOOGLE ADS<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-510710\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Google-Ads.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Google-Ads.png 602w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Google-Ads-300x199.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Google-Ads-600x399.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To people new to digital marketing, buzzwords like PPC, CPC, bids, and campaigns may sound a bit alien.
