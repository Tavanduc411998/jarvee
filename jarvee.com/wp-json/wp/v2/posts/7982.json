This has prompted a lot of businesses to create an online presence for the purposes of marketing their products. Any business worth its salt has to have an online presence to be able to compete effectively with other businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Social media has become the most preferred way of interacting, with over 5 billion people registered in the world&#8217;s largest social network &#8211; Facebook. That is over 80% of the world&#8217;s current population. Imagine if you could spread your message to such a huge multitude of people at the same time &#8211; even past kings did not have that kind of power! Today, you can reach audiences globally and overseas using social media sites such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Tiktok, YouTube and LinkedIn. You can even reach audiences from space like the ISS astronauts do when they broadcast live on YouTube.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some surefire ways to drive traffic to your business site using social media:<\/p>\n<h2>#1 Content Curation<\/h2>\n<h4>Offer Value<\/h4>\n<p>Your customers are not here to see old content or clich\u00e9 content. They want to hear something new, something groundbreaking. Write the facts in a different way that will inspire them and make them buy your product. Do new research on the topics you desire to create content on and produce new fresh content. Keep up with the current trends and inform your customers of the new developments in the industry.<\/p>\n<h4>Tailor Your Content<\/h4>\n<p>Understand your audience and tailor your content to fit them. Understand their background and what makes them tick. Then you will be able to create content that will impact their lives.<\/p>\n<h4>Content is King<\/h4>\n<p>Do not scrape the web for information and rewrite it for your audience. With the huge masses of people and scrappers online, chances are they have heard or seen the content in some other place somewhere. Create fresh new content aligned with the needs of your audience and you will capture them for life. Create daily or weekly, but make sure you are consistent on churning out new content, never stop writing.<\/p>\n<h4>Rewrite Old Content<\/h4>\n<p>If some of your content ages for a year or two, rewrite it afresh to attract new clients. If there are new facts include them.<br \/>\nOffer Free Courses\/Content\/Infographics\/Surveys<br \/>\nOffer your visitors free goodies often to keep them glued to your social media page. These might be free ebooks, surveys, infographics, or courses, they will keep coming for more.<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/facebook-marketing.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"567\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8064\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/facebook-marketing.jpg 850w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/facebook-marketing-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/facebook-marketing-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/facebook-marketing-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>#2 Social Media Marketing<\/h2>\n<h4>Purchase Ads<\/h4>\n<p>You need to use paid ads to get your message across wider audiences especially those you cannot reach like people in different overseas countries. With paid ads, the social media company will target your offering to a larger audience than you could as an individual.<\/p>\n<h4>Create Tutorials<\/h4>\n<p>You can create Tutorials on YouTube on the usage of your product. This will help people have an easier time using your product.<\/p>\n<h4>Answer questions on authority sites<\/h4>\n<p>Answer questions on sites like Quora or Yahoo Answers. You can also write content on Medium and advice people using the knowledge you possess in your industry. Get into groups on Facebook and create informative posts about your offering.<\/p>\n<h4>Socialize on Social Platforms<\/h4>\n<p>Create partnerships on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and you might even get customers from those partnerships. Help people online and they will come back for more. Your friends and followers are your first and closest market.<\/p>\n<h4>Cross Channel linking<\/h4>\n<p>If you create a nice informative post on one social media site, make sure you share it across all other platforms so that more people will see it. The more the readers the better the chances you have of getting a paying customer.<\/p>\n<h2>#3 Email Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Social sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook will give you an option to view users&#8217; emails. Scrape the emails and build a list. Then use scheduling tools such as MailChimp to send tailored marketing messages to these potential clients.<br \/>\nIf the social platform does not give permission to view users&#8217; emails, it may be best to cold message them and ask for emails or ask them to view your website. Approach softly and politely and you will get positive responses most of the time.<br \/>\nOffer a free subscription in exchange for an email. If you have a cheap version of your product, you can offer it for free on social media, provided the benefactors give you all their contacts, or emails.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/social-media-analytics-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"567\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8063\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/social-media-analytics-1.jpg 850w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/social-media-analytics-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/social-media-analytics-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/social-media-analytics-1-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>#4 Analytics<\/h2>\n<h4>Monitor Ad spend<\/h4>\n<p>Track the amount you have spent on advertisements and how much of it has brought a positive impact<\/p>\n<h4>Monitor visitors\/hr\/day<\/h4>\n<p>You should have a dashboard to inform you of your visitor&#8217;s health. You should focus on how many visitors do you get from social media to your site per day, hour, or minute. You should also be aware of customer churn, how many visitors come to your site but later defect and never return. <\/p>\n<h4>Monitor churn<\/h4>\n<p>Track changes in customer behavior. You will notice when customers visit your site, what actions they take and which content they view most. Using this information, you can optimize your site and content for your visitors.<\/p>\n<h2>#5 Influencer Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Identify impactful influencers for your target market and establish mutual partnerships with them. Utilize their services and spread your message using their channels. Complement this campaign with nano-influencers, who are influencers with a much smaller following. This ensures your message hits a wider audience.<\/p>\n<h2>#6 Media Design and Response<\/h2>\n<p>Your content should be beautifully designed. It should be attractive to the reader so much so that he\/she is glued and cannot get out of the page. Images and graphics should be of high quality, infographics on the other hand should contain attractive graphs and charts. Use AMP Accelerated Media Pages on Facebook to increase loading speed which gives the customer a much better experience.<\/p>\n<h2>#7 Lead Generation<\/h2>\n<p>Have clean curated landing pages targeted for your ideal clients. The landing page should communicate your offering in a simple way and offer the client a chance to join your business. There should be a contact form so that clients can provide their email and contact information. You should also include your contacts so that prospective customers can reach you in case of any queries. Broadcast your offering on various social sites and you might get ready customers.<\/p>\n<h2>#8 Conversion Funnel<\/h2>\n<p>Optimize your conversion funnel. Make the customer aware of your offering. Spark an interest in them that they keep on reading on the product. They will desire your product and get to buy the product.<\/p>\n<p>Optimize your social sites using A\/B testing until you get the right recipe that funnels customers right to your website.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>You should notice a higher retention rate and a higher visitor gain rate if you do all the above correctly. Provide quality valuable content, optimize it and track your customer&#8217;s behavior and you will be on the road to success.<\/p>\n<h2>Author Bio<\/h2>\n<p>Karl Murphy is a professional journalist from Des Moines, Iowa.
