Due to the fact that Instagram only allows a maximum of 7500 people to be followed by an account, if you keep following, you\u2019ll soon see that you need to start unfollowing or you\u2019ll have to abandon this growth strategy.<\/p>\n<p>So far, Instagram seems to have separate limits for following and unfollowing and they are not tied to each other. Meaning that if you follow to the maximum that you can in one day, that doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t be able to do unfollow actions.<\/p>\n<p>This is pretty much a set-and-forget tool, once properly set up and started there won\u2019t be any need to make adjustments.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/how-to-set-up-the-jarvee-unfollow-tool.jpg\" alt=\"how to set up the jarvee unfollow tool\" width=\"872\" height=\"412\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4795\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/how-to-set-up-the-jarvee-unfollow-tool.jpg 872w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/how-to-set-up-the-jarvee-unfollow-tool-300x142.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/how-to-set-up-the-jarvee-unfollow-tool-768x363.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/how-to-set-up-the-jarvee-unfollow-tool-600x283.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 872px) 100vw, 872px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what we\u2019ll be talking about:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>When should you start unfollowing<\/li>\n<li>Can you do it on the same days you do follows<\/li>\n<li>How many unfollows can you do so your account is safe<\/li>\n<li>What filters to use<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>1. When should you start unfollowing<\/h3>\n<p>As before, it depends, if your account is old and with a decent amount of activity on it, you can start unfollowing right away. If your account is new, however, you should give it some time before starting this tool, there\u2019s no hurry as it will take some time to reach the maximum limit anyway.<\/p>\n<p>I usually set the unfollow tool the same for all fresh and old accounts, with one difference, I will start the tool immediately on the old accounts and only after a 3-4 weeks period of other activity on the new accounts.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how it should look like:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/jarvee-instagram-unfollow-settings.jpg\" alt=\"jarvee instagram unfollow settings\" width=\"980\" height=\"501\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4792\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/jarvee-instagram-unfollow-settings.jpg 980w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/jarvee-instagram-unfollow-settings-300x153.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/jarvee-instagram-unfollow-settings-768x393.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/jarvee-instagram-unfollow-settings-600x307.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Remember to start it up once you\u2019re ready with the settings if the account is old. If it\u2019s new, make a calendar note to start it in 3-4 weeks time.<\/p>\n<p>The time to unfollow is set for 4-5.5 days, this should be enough time for anyone that you followed to follow back if he\/she ever will. This does depend on the kind of accounts you\u2019re running, though. This is mainly for legit business accounts. If you\u2019re doing CPA or anything similar, 2-3 days should be more than enough here.<\/p>\n<p>As for the other settings, they will reach their maximum in about 15-18 days and since you won\u2019t be following more than 200 per day there should be no need to unfollow more than that either.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Can you do it on the same days you do follows?<\/h3>\n<p>This is a question that I\u2019ve seen asked a lot. Answers are split and some people will say they have certain days in which they follow and other days in which they unfollow and if they mix those their accounts get in trouble. Others swear that\u2019s not true and they follow and unfollow in the same day and they\u2019re just fine.<\/p>\n<p>I think it\u2019s a personal preference, either way, will work. The way I do it though is: I do both actions on the same days. I do believe that this makes the account look more legit, after all, there are very few normal people that do these actions on different days, I think it\u2019s more natural to make them together.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to mix it up though, that will work too, pick a day in which you won\u2019t follow and another one in which you won\u2019t unfollow and you\u2019re good to go.<\/p>\n<h3>3.  How many unfollows can you do so your account is safe<\/h3>\n<p>You can see my suggestion on this in the images above on how to set it up correctly. This is for normal accounts though, that hasn\u2019t reached the top limit yet. On rare occasions, you might end up with an account that has reached the 7500 maximum people it can follow and you need to unfollow fast.<\/p>\n<p>As with anything concerning Instagram, I don\u2019t suggest going too fast. Yes, you can go above the 200\/ day limit and you should be fine, a maximum of 400 per day should be quite doable, but don\u2019t jump on it from the first day, set it up as above, slowly at first and increase the unfollow limits to a maximum of 400 per day. It will take a while and for a few days you\u2019ll be limited on the number of people you can follow, however, you will soon see that the follows\/followers balance is tilting the right way.<\/p>\n<h3>4.  What filters to use<\/h3>\n<p>Now let\u2019s see the filters:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/jarvee-instagram-unfollow-user-filters.jpg\" alt=\"jarvee instagram unfollow user filters\" width=\"986\" height=\"375\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4793\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/jarvee-instagram-unfollow-user-filters.jpg 986w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/jarvee-instagram-unfollow-user-filters-300x114.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/jarvee-instagram-unfollow-user-filters-768x292.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/jarvee-instagram-unfollow-user-filters-600x228.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>These are the filters that I usually use, however you should set up this part according to your needs. For example, if you only care about your account growing and you\u2019re planning to grow it above the 7500 limit that means you\u2019ll have to unfollow everyone, not just the ones that did not follow back. If not, once you reach 7500 followers you\u2019ll also have 7500 people you follow and the growth stops.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re well below the 7500 limit though, you can increase the time it takes to unfollow people that followed back. Some will have followed back because they are using automation too so you will definitely lose those. It\u2019s a numbers game after all.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to play around and keep the people engaging with the account you can choose to not unfollow the ones that comment\/like or do any of the other actions. Also, you can set up a whitelist and add specific usernames there that will never be unfollowed.<\/p>\n<p>There are no good or bad setups here, it will depend on your needs so don\u2019t be afraid to play around with the settings.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Unfollow strategy is closely related to the follow strategy that we talked about in my previous post.
