This Instagram feature only requires a few minutes of your time while it can boost your brand recognition. The fact that it isn\u2019t permanent also allows you to experiment with your marketing strategies with it.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram stories are becoming very popular these days. <a href=\"https:\/\/techjury.net\/blog\/instagram-stories-statistics\/\">More than 70% of Instagram users<\/a> take time to watch Instagram stories daily, and every year, mobile video consumption is doubling. With all of these in place, there&#8217;s no excuse not to be making Instagram stories by now.<\/p>\n<p>Even with the accessible nature of Instagram, it can be hard to pick the right Instagram story to post, especially for your business. This is why this article contains a list of ideas for Instagram stories that can help you boost the number of followers you have on Instagram.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7925\" style=\"width: 860px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7925\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7925\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/instagram-marketing-with-stories.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"567\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/instagram-marketing-with-stories.jpg 850w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/instagram-marketing-with-stories-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/instagram-marketing-with-stories-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/instagram-marketing-with-stories-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-7925\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Unsplash<\/p><\/div>\n<h2>#1 Answer questions<\/h2>\n<p>The easiest way for you to get engagement for yourself is by asking people questions about your business. There is no question that you cannot answer. This allows your audience to interact and <a href=\"https:\/\/biteable.com\/blog\/instagram-story-ideas\/\">engage with your Instagram story<\/a> while giving you a chance to prove yourself to be an authority in your industry and on that subject matter. You can also create a video of answers to the questions using the \u201cmaster video\u201d to create and save videos about her.<\/p>\n<h2>#2 Ask questions<\/h2>\n<p>One of the easiest ways to get customers\u2019 insight into a service or product that you are marketing is to ask your audience some questions regarding it. This is a viable idea for your Instagram story, as it offers you an opportunity to get much customer insight. Include an answer sticker on your stories so that the audience can submit their replies.<\/p>\n<p>Also, if you are not sure of the content to produce and publish next, and you lack Instagram story ideas, you can ask your audience questions on what content they expect from you next. So, you know what they want, and you can give it to them. This is a win-win situation for both parties as they are getting the content they want while also getting the engagement you need.<\/p>\n<h2>#3 Polls and quizzes<\/h2>\n<p>Rather than ask your open-ended audience questions, you can run a quiz or a poll for them. This is one way to guide the answers that they proffer to your questions if you need it to be streamlined. You can do this by using stickers.<\/p>\n<p>With a poll or quiz, you are engaging your audience with multiple choice answers. This makes it easier for you to get engagement as they only need to click a button to engage your post instead of having to time in response. You can also use a sliding react that is simple and effective in situations when you post something that deserves the hype, even if it\u2019s just your full cookie jar.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7926\" style=\"width: 860px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7926\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7926\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/instagram-stories-ideas.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"567\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/instagram-stories-ideas.jpg 850w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/instagram-stories-ideas-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/instagram-stories-ideas-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/instagram-stories-ideas-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-7926\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Unsplash<\/p><\/div>\n<h2>#4 Promote your product<\/h2>\n<p>As a business, you still have the goal of increasing your sales and generating more revenue. You can use your <a href=\"https:\/\/jessicathiefels.com\/blog\/instagram-story-ideas\/\">Instagram story<\/a> to promote your service or product. This way, you are sure to get more hype and an increase in brand recognition. It makes it easy for your audience and followers to get information about your service or products (which is an advertisement) without necessarily splashing the cash in the name of running ads.<\/p>\n<p>You can make use of product stickers, which can lead the audience straight to the purchase page. You have to note here that you use product stickers to approve the business on Instagram. The alternative you have is to use the Traditional \u201cSwipe up\u201d feature on the Instagram story, which links to another website.<\/p>\n<h2>#5 Host a contest<\/h2>\n<p>Hosting a contest is one easy way for you to drive engagement to your Instagram profile. All you need to do is ask your audience to write their own story that they will tag your account to, or they comment under your story, or they like your last posts. Then you are on the lookout. Check your notifications well and go through all of their entries before determining a winner after 24 hours. You can choose your winner through another app. In that case, you screen record yourself using that app to share the videos and determine who is sharing videos with her.<\/p>\n<h2>#6 Customer spotlight<\/h2>\n<p>As a brand, you can use the customer spotlight to win over more followers to yourself, but you can win new customers over much more than this. Customer spotlight is you highlighting a customer to get more people on board. You can do this with their testimonials about your product or service. You can also provide insight from the customer about your service or products\u2019 effect or impact on their life. Other options for you to put customers in the spotlight are sending shout outs to customers making a big order, wildly showcasing your products. You can also say thank you to those that have been your customers and have provided you with support from day one.<\/p>\n<h2>#7 Go live<\/h2>\n<p>This is like gold for your <a href=\"https:\/\/about.easil.com\/easy-instagram-story-ideas\/\">Instagram engagement<\/a>, and there are numerous reasons for that. Firstly, live broadcasts enjoy preferential treatment from Instagram, so you\u2019re literally in the faces of their audience. Also, it is easy to engage your audience directly and immediately. Comments and likes from the viewers are shown in real-time. As a bonus, the live stream that you do will be available for those that missed it as an Instagram story. Once you get stuck, many story ideas can also work as a live video.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Instagram features are an exciting feature for Instagram users. They are something that you can easily capitalize on for your gain, to make more followers for your brand and more engagement. Try to also include newer features into your Instagram stories whenever they are released. However, in everything that you do, you must never forget to remain authentic with everything. Remain true to yourself and your brand.<\/p>\n<h4>Author\u2019s Bio:<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Thomas Lanigan<\/strong> has work experience for four years as a marketing specialist, social media manager, writer, journalist, and editor at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.essaygeeks.co.uk\/\">the best essay writing service in the UK<\/a>.
