That not less than 80% of Instagram users follow at least one business profile daily makes it even more of an attractive destination for businesses trying to engage customers and raising brand awareness. <\/p>\n<p>Even though <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/\">Instagram<\/a> reports the highest level of user engagement among all social media channels, and allows brands to market their products and services to a more targeted audience, getting started on Instagram for business can be a daunting task unless you know how. <\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4936\" style=\"width: 1063px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4936\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Making-Your-Instagram-Business-Successful.jpg\" alt=\"Making Your Instagram Business Successful\" width=\"1053\" height=\"577\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4936\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Making-Your-Instagram-Business-Successful.jpg 1053w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Making-Your-Instagram-Business-Successful-300x164.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Making-Your-Instagram-Business-Successful-768x421.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Making-Your-Instagram-Business-Successful-1024x561.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Making-Your-Instagram-Business-Successful-600x329.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Making-Your-Instagram-Business-Successful-400x218.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1053px) 100vw, 1053px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-4936\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Making Your Instagram Business Successful<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Here are some practical and useful tips for brand managers trying to ride the social media boom, especially Instagram:<\/p>\n<h3>Publish Value-Added Content <\/h3>\n<p>The only reason why people will invest their precious time on following your Instagram account is that they will get to see some amazing visuals along with information that is really valuable to them. Even though Instagram has the highest rate of engagement among all social media channels, you really can\u2019t take it for granted that you will have a steady stream of visitors without you having posted content that is entertaining, engaging, and informative. It is very important for you to stay focused on delighting your customers in such a way that customers automatically become motivated to look out for your content. <\/p>\n<p>While using images of your own products is always a good idea, it is not necessary to do it all the time as audiences can feel bored and think of your account as being too sales-oriented. Rather, if you play around with a theme that has a direct connection with your product, you will have far more flexibility in offering them entertaining engagement.\u00a0 What you really need to keep in mind that users want to be entertained with high-quality photos and videos not forcibly educated on your product features. Content that entertains as well as educates strike the best balance and allows you to grow the number of your Instagram followers rapidly.<\/p>\n<h3>Follow a Consistent Theme across All Your Instagram Posts <\/h3>\n<p>One of the most important elements of being successful with Instagram is that all your posts have to be thematically uniform to lend your brand visual strength. Just like the individual pages of a website of a company are tied together with a common theme to present a uniform look to the user, your Instagram posts too should be thematically uniform. The square dimensions of all Instagram photos already make the job easier for you. All you need to do is to create an aesthetic appeal that can be carried forward to all your posts to create a unified theme- this can be done very easily with a color combination that can be inspired from your brand or logo colors to make them look uniform. <\/p>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https:\/\/photomania.net\">use a filter<\/a> to make your posts look more appealing \u2013 by using the filter consistently on each and every post, you can make it a property of your Instagram account and users will immediately know that a particular post is by you. However, a unified theme is not only about the design and the aesthetics but also about the adoption of a tone of voice that is consistent, about the use of photo captions, and about the use of hashtags. While diversity in the content of posts is welcome, having multiple themes only serves to confuse the users regarding brand identity.<\/p>\n<h3>Engage Proactively with Your Audience <\/h3>\n<p>It is important to understand that brand promotion can never be a one-way street. It is vital that you take into consideration the user feedback on the many aspects of your business.The best way to get to know what your followers are thinking is to engage with them. You can directly ask for their opinions making the process interactive and fun or respond to their comments, queries, and observations. As a responsible marketer, it is very important that you never let an opportunity go of interacting with your followers. <\/p>\n<p>When businesses interact with Instagram followers, it helps them to feel valued and more connected to your brand and business. When brand loyalty is established, it automatically boosts the number of conversions and adds to the business profitability. Organizing contests and polls on a variety of topics and giving them attractive prizes and freebies goes a long way in building engagement. The simpler the contest, the better the participation and impact; for example, a tag-a-friend contest with an attractive prize will contribute greatly to increasing the number of followers and traffic to your website.<\/p>\n<h3>Including Filters and Editing Photos <\/h3>\n<p>Ever wonder why some photographs simply look so great?
