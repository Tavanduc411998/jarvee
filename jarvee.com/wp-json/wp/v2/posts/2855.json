The mindset should change since the trend is already gearing towards this kind of marketing.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest social networks when it comes to B2B or B2C community should start optimizing their content for this kind of marketing if they have not done it yet and here\u2019s how:<\/p>\n<h3>Optimizing Facebook for Mobile<\/h3>\n<p><b>#1.
