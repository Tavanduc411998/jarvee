This article will go through some tips on how you can create an awesome blog post that will convert readers into customers!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10516\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/How-To-Create-A-Blog-Post-That-Will-Convert-Readers-Into-Customers.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/How-To-Create-A-Blog-Post-That-Will-Convert-Readers-Into-Customers.png 602w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/How-To-Create-A-Blog-Post-That-Will-Convert-Readers-Into-Customers-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/How-To-Create-A-Blog-Post-That-Will-Convert-Readers-Into-Customers-600x400.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Start With A Story<\/h3>\n<p>Do you want to know what separates amateurs from professionals? It\u2019s the story. Pros have stories that capture attention, pull people in, and make them care about your product or service. The problem is that most people aren&#8217;t very good at telling stories. They drone on and on about mundane or unbelievable events that don&#8217;t appeal to their audience. Luckily, there\u2019s a way to fix this. There&#8217;s a <a href=\"https:\/\/anyword.com\">copywriting software by Anyword<\/a> that can take your content and make it sound like you wrote it off the top of your head, not like something that was written using copywriting software. It doesn\u2019t modify the meaning or context of what you write; instead, they focus on making sure every sentence is simple, clear, to-the-point perfection (and full of stories!).<\/p>\n<h3>Make A Point<\/h3>\n<p>Every blog post you write should have a point. There needs to be something that the reader will walk away with after reading your content and it has to be valuable enough for them to <a href=\"https:\/\/sharethis.com\/best-practices\/2017\/09\/blogging-tips-to-keep-readers-engaged\/\">stay engaged throughout<\/a> or else they\u2019ll stop reading as soon as they feel like what was written isn\u2019t relevant to them. This is the whole point of creating content, you want people to walk away with something that they can find helpful.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re struggling to create a point for your blog post then ask yourself questions like: What are my customers looking for? What do I think will help them out most in their current situation? How does this topic affect what they\u2019re interested in learning about today? etc&#8230; By asking these types of questions before writing anything it makes it easier to focus on delivering value because you have an idea already formed within your mind as well as rich topics and points that tie into each other so no matter which one you choose there should be some type of connection between all three options.<\/p>\n<h3>Include Facts<\/h3>\n<p>Including facts is a good way to convince readers because it gives them solid evidence. In addition, including relevant statistics may help prove your point. For example, &#8220;Our research shows that 93% of users prefer interface A over B.&#8221; Finally, include quotes from experts or studies showing the results if possible. However, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/beginner-blogger-mistakes\">be careful with this type of information<\/a> as well since some people don&#8217;t appreciate any marketing strategies and will not take you seriously. Make sure all facts are correct and accurate before using them in an article. If they aren\u2019t then it can paint your business in a negative light which isn\u2019t something anyone wants when trying to gain customers through blog posts!<\/p>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10520\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/State-Your-Opinion.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"553\" height=\"369\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/State-Your-Opinion.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/State-Your-Opinion-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/State-Your-Opinion-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>State Your Opinion<\/h3>\n<p>Blogging is a form of dialogue. Your blog post should be a conversation between you and your readers &#8211; not an instructional essay for students to read in school. People want to hear from real people who have opinions that they can relate with, which means it\u2019s important that when writing your content, you state how you feel about the topic at hand. If there are arguments presented on either side of what you&#8217;re discussing, address them all before sharing your opinion so no one feels left out or unheard.<\/p>\n<h3>End With A Call To Action<\/h3>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve gone through all these steps, it is time to end the blog post. The last paragraph should be a Call To Action (CTA) with instructions on what your intended audience members are supposed to do next. This might include asking them to subscribe for updates, leave their email address to download something or purchase one of your products\/services. A great way of writing this part is by using action verbs and avoiding simply stating anything like \u201cclick here\u201d or \u201cvisit our website now!\u201d as those words don&#8217;t work well anymore. Instead, be specific about what you want them to do by using words. If your blog post is long enough that it could end with multiple paragraphs of text then split the CTA into parts if necessary. For example, in a blog post, you can use two different calls to action at the very bottom: one for people who are interested in blogging and another for those looking for help creating a social media strategy. Once again, make sure there isn&#8217;t any space between these CTA sentences\/paragraphs so they look consistent within the rest of your content.<\/p>\n<h3>Link To A Related Post<\/h3>\n<p>After you\u2019ve published your blog post, make sure to include a link back to an older post on the site. This is especially important if that other post has more in-depth information about your topic or can tell readers what they won&#8217;t learn from your new article. You&#8217;ll also want to check the performance of each of those posts and see how it&#8217;s doing compared to others by checking stats like pageviews per visit, average time on site, etc. If one particular piece of content is performing well with visitors but not so much for <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/search-engine-optimization-guide-for-beginners\/\">search engines<\/a>, then consider linking out to it within future articles. When someone clicks through for this related material after reading yours, they are likely interested in learning even more about the subject matter at hand. Those people are more likely to become your customers or at least turn into repeat visitors who check back in with the site for additional information over time.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10517\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Link-To-A-Related-Post.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Link-To-A-Related-Post.png 602w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Link-To-A-Related-Post-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/Link-To-A-Related-Post-600x400.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The best blog posts are the ones that relate to your audience. They\u2019re informative, interesting, and useful.\u00a0 This is what you should be trying to achieve every time you write a post for your website or social media accounts! Starting with a story gives people something they can relate to, whether it\u2019s their experiences or something they\u2019ve read online. You can then include facts and statistics that support your story.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Author<\/h3>\n<p>Delton McDonald works in the digital marketing field.
