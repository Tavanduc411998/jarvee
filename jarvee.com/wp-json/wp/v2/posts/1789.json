She explains the choice overload problem as stretching your brand too thin, making it unrecognizable and difficult to engage with. When she was a graduate student, she conducted an experiment at a local grocery store. Findings in this experiment led to a great finding on a company\u2019s marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<p>This TED Talk helped Iyengar see that when people are presented more options, 20% more people stopped for samples. However, people who were presented fewer options bought more which makes the form of presentation as a more effective marketing too. People frequently \u2018choose not to choose,\u2019 which means lost revenue for the business.<\/p>\n<p>It is emphasized in her TED Talk that when the choice presented to consumers is of greater import, they are more likely to be overwhelmed by \u2018choice overload.\u2019 When an offering if of high cost, come up with a way to show them various courses of action and reserve the detail-oriented selection later on. This allows the consumer to become more proactive and engaged.<\/p>\n<p>The topic on this TED Talk can be applied in one\u2019s daily manner of making choices. We have the tendency to tackle easy matters first, then those which are more challenging after. Now let\u2019s look at it in a business perspective: in the mind of a potential customer, they would be drawn to a product which inspires them to take action easily. Guide them to a high-level decision first, then move on to more detailed material after.<\/p>\n<h3>#5\u00a0Seth Godin: The Tribes We Lead<\/h3>\n<a id=\"61c55b63efbd3\" rel=\"wp-video-lightbox\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uQGYr9bnktw&#038;width=640&#038;height=480\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/seth-godin.jpg\" class=\"video_lightbox_anchor_image\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a>    <script>\r\n    \/* <![CDATA[ *\/\r\n    jQuery(document).ready(function($){\r\n        $(function(){\r\n            var width = $(window).innerWidth();\r\n            var setwidth = 640;\r\n            var ratio = 0.75;\r\n            var height = 480;\r\n            var link = 'https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uQGYr9bnktw&width=640&height=480';\r\n            if(width < setwidth)\r\n            {\r\n                height = Math.floor(width * 0.75);\r\n                \/\/console.log(\"device width \"+width+\", set width \"+640+\", ratio \"+0.75+\", new height \"+ height);\r\n                var new_url = wpvl_paramReplace('width', link, width);\r\n                var new_url = wpvl_paramReplace('height', new_url, height);\r\n                $(\"a#61c55b63efbd3\").attr('href', new_url);\r\n                \/\/console.log(new_url);\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n    \/* ]]> *\/\r\n    <\/script>\n<p>Seth Godin hosts this TED Talk in a critical manner discussing societal trends that take people to where they are, otherwise known as a cultural moment. This point in time, the present, is vital in the way ideas are produced and proliferated. He explains that in the 1950\u2019s when television came into its own, even a mediocre idea can be mass marketed. Conditions for this marketing strategy was it could easily be taken apart into an easily understandable 30-second advertisement through an extensive, expensive marketing budget.<\/p>\n<p>In this TED Talk, this model is being substituted by a seemingly infinite series of tribes as our lives become increasingly digitized. Godin differentiates this from a sociocultural grouping mechanism to ideological groups in the modern century. TOMS Shoes has become a great example of the application of this phenomenon.<\/p>\n<p>The tribe that the company created to cater to was the segment of millennials with a social conscience: that was being discussed in this TED Talk. However, these people are unsure on how to give back on a daily basis. Blake Mycoskie, the founder of TOMS Shoes, came up with a brand that narrates a story that attracts these millennials.<\/p>\n<p>Godin also shared on this TED Talk that with each purchase of TOMS shoes, an identical pair is donated to someone without footwear. The company has grabbed the attention of their best audience and turned them into marketers of their brand by reaching out to those in need. The company was able to devise a wise, persuasive, and interesting way to challenge the status quo while developing their brand and narrating a story.<\/p>\n<h3>Wrapping it up<\/h3>\n<p>These TED Talks inspire marketers with the much-needed inspiration to keep them creative and motivated in their work.
