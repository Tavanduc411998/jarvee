					<description><![CDATA[Good ideas guys, thank you! I like the idea about announcements about your employees on social media, will suggest something like this to our HR team. It&#039;s good for employees to feel more appreciated and for the brand image as well, since customers will like this as well!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with all five things - would just add that you can use social media at work for problem solving! 
For example, you put your problem up on the social media site and ask for input from other employees. You never know who might present with the best solution, not to mention that the more people are working to find a solution, the faster you&#039;ll get to it.
This way you also identify creative thinkers and can connect with your colleagues you perhaps usually don&#039;t have much interaction on a daily basis.]]></description>
