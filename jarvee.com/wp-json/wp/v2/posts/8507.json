Businesses used to interact with consumers through their social media pages in the last couple of decades. But then, social media has changed this by introducing auto logins from various social media channels.<\/p>\n<p>Many internet users get intimidated by websites that require signing up.

Social media has traditionally enabled sharing of content within itself. The sharing of content between social media and websites is a new trend inspired by social media sharing.<\/p>\n<p>As a website owner, you need to ensure that people can share texts, links, images, and videos from your website. You should enable sharing from your website to another or social media platforms. Web designers are keen on taking advantage of this trend.<\/p>\n<p>Focus on creating compelling content that will ignite something in your audience. Besides, include a share button on every page of your site to ensure that your content reaches a wider audience.<\/p>\n<h3>3.\u00a0\u00a0 Using Images<\/h3>\n<p>Social media images bring better results compared to textual content. Many businesses are focusing on creating visual elements that will aid in product advertisements. The success that images have had in social media advertising has made website owners consider using them in their sites.<\/p>\n<p>However, the images used on social media need to get optimized to bring in the desired results.

Now, you cannot expect excellent results from a website if you do not optimize images properly.<\/p>\n<h3>4.\u00a0\u00a0 Embed YouTube Videos<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8512\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Embed-YouTube-Videos.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Embed-YouTube-Videos.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Embed-YouTube-Videos-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Embed-YouTube-Videos-600x338.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>YouTube is another critical social media channel that has impacted websites positively. Website owners are taking advantage of YouTube by embedding videos from the platform in their websites. Now, website visitors can watch your YouTube videos without clicking away from your site.<\/p>\n<p>You must keep your business needs in mind when adding videos to your website. Creating short videos that communicate the message quickly will give you the results you desire. Besides, the <u><a href=\"https:\/\/animoto.com\/blog\/video-marketing\/embed-video-on-website\">embedding of YouTube videos<\/a><\/u> in websites has made it vital for businesses to build social media-friendly websites.<\/p>\n<h3>5.\u00a0\u00a0 Make Your Web Design is Social Media Platform-Friendly<\/h3>\n<p>Social media has made it necessary for web designers to create social media channels friendly websites.

Instead of clicking away from your website to check for reviews, you can design your website and designate a section for reviews. Add screenshots of previous customer reviews, and you&#8217;ll reduce the work your clients have to do.<\/p>\n<h3>8.\u00a0\u00a0 Design for Ads Displayed on Social Media<\/h3>\n<p>Social media is one of the best communication tools we have today.
