Yes, image will create the first impression and create an idea about the post topic, but if you mess it up with a very bad caption that doesn&#039;t fit the idea, your brand&#039;s credibility will be shaken]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I really like how you guys shared that caption type. I see that every once in a while JARVEE drops some golden tips. Nice job guys

Captions are genuinely very overlooked however, captions are literally sometimes the deciding factor for shares. i have done a few split tests before and making short, funny or witty captions ( of course it depends on the audience ) is something that drives great results!]]></description>
