Your posts must be easy to find on Instagram to get more eyeballs to it and receive the likes and comments it deserves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">To do this, you must\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/databox.com\/instagram-marketing-strategies-b2b#specific-hashtags\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">include the right hashtags<\/span><\/u><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0for each of your content.

Here a few questions to ask yourself when looking at their profiles:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u25cf What types of posts do they publish (videos, images, personal, etc.)?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u25cf Why do they share these on Instagram (to grow followers, to get clients, advertising opportunities, etc.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u25cf What content do people respond to the most?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">From here, you\u2019ll have a basic idea of the things you could emulate on your Instagram account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Next,\u00a0<\/span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">look for people who follow similar artists but not you<\/span><\/em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">. The fact that they follow them could mean they might be interested in your artworks as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can use JARVEE to\u00a0<\/span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">gather followers, likers, and commenters of your competitors<\/span><\/strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">. The goal here is to hopefully turn them into your followers as well. The fact that they\u2019re following similar artists gives you a good chance of turning them into followers if you play your cards right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">But for that to happen, you need to understand why they follow your competitors in the first place. By adopting some of the tactics they use on Instagram, you can strengthen your case of turning them into followers once you start reaching out to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Make a Compelling Case in Your Bio<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Your Instagram bio serves as a bridge between people becoming followers or clients.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Think of the images you share as bait. If people take the bait, they\u2019ll go straight to your bio section to learn more about you and your work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The problem with Instagram\u2019s bio section is that\u00a0<\/span><em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">it leaves little to no room for you to introduce yourself properly<\/span><\/em><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Aside from the character count, you can\u2019t link out to your website even from your bio section. Crazy, I know!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">However, take this as a challenge to get creative in\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.mageplaza.com\/blog\/tips-to-make-ecommerce-website-popular-through-instagram.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">optimizing your bio<\/span><\/u><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, which is key to artists who sell their work online.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A way of doing this is by\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/joturl.com\/blog\/boost-your-instagram-bio\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">using a link in the bio tool<\/span><\/u><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">. Create a page that compiles links to your social media and your best works that you can\u2019t post on Instagram.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This way, you have all the important information that everyone needs to know about you as an artist in a single place such as videos, sample works, and more. Then just link to the page on your bio for everyone to see.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Jump Into Conversations<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8374 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/growing-instagram-engagment.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"403\" height=\"403\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/growing-instagram-engagment.png 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/growing-instagram-engagment-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/growing-instagram-engagment-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/growing-instagram-engagment-600x600.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">As with most social platforms,\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/kitelytech.com\/turn-instagram-into-insta-gold-for-your-small-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">engagement in the name of the game<\/span><\/u><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">.
