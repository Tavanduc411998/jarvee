					<description><![CDATA[I see so many people with incomplete social profiles. Not only does that give you a very unprofessional look, but it actually misses out some potential search traffic. And as the post states, some people may use the companies location or address to search, and if they don&#039;t find it, a potential lead goes to waste..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great article, I&#039;d like to add another thing. Many people over optimize their meta descriptions by fluffing it with keywords. That will cause a Google penalty for sure, this is not 2008 people.. 1-2 target keywords with 2-3 LSI keywords will work great.]]></description>
