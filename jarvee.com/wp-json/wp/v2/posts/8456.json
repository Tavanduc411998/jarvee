Some types of content can be interesting for the general public, but if you are working in a specific niche and your content is related to a specific area of interest, then you should think twice before wasting your content by posting it randomly everywhere.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t want your content to be wasted and you want it to reach its best potential, then you should read the tips we will share with you here and use them to start getting targeted traffic with Jarvee.<\/p>\n<h2>Identifying your niche and relevant keywords<\/h2>\n<p>You need to properly define the basis of your strategy &#8211; the niche where the field of your action will be. When this is defined, then you can brainstorm and collect all relevant keywords that can be used to find the type of groups where your target audience will be.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if your niche is fitness, your keywords can be fitness, wellbeing, workout, bodybuilding, gym, etc.<\/p>\n<h2>Setting us the group Finder tool<\/h2>\n<p>These keywords can be used within the <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/knowledge-base\/finder\/\">Group finder<\/a> to search and extract relevant Facebook groups automatically. Doing this automatically saves a lot of your time and allows you to do other stuff while this is being done automatically. You can see here how the group Finder looks like:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/group-finder-1024x710.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"806\" height=\"559\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can set one or multiple keywords that you want to be extracted, set the desired filters, and click on Extract Groups. The Finder tool will do all the work for you and extract a list of relevant groups that it finds when doing this search on Facebook, through your Facebook profile.<\/p>\n<p>Once the groups are extracted, you can select all or choose those that you find appropriate and then click on the SEND TO JOINER TOOL button. These groups will be sent to the <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/knowledge-base\/joiner\/\">Joiner tool<\/a> in just a few steps.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/send-to-joiner-tool-1024x437.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"804\" height=\"343\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Setting your account to join niche related group automatically<\/h2>\n<p>Once your groups are sent to the Joiner tool, you can visit your Joiner tool tab and set up the settings from there.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/joiner-tool-settings-1024x789.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"801\" height=\"617\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This tool allows you also to join groups as a page if you already have your company page. If your page is well set and it has some social proof, it would be a good move to also join groups as your page and post to these groups as your page.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure that the settings you will use here are not too aggressive and that they look like human behavior.<\/p>\n<p>Another amazing feature that this tool has is that you can even join groups that require join questions to be answered. You can set your auto answer list that Jarvee will use to send join requests to these groups.<\/p>\n<h2>Creating a campaign that will automatically post to the chosen groups<\/h2>\n<p>Once you have a decent amount of groups that you are part of and if you have prepared a post list with posts that lead to the content you created on your website, it\u2019s time to create a <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/knowledge-base\/standard-campaigns\/\">Standard Campaign<\/a> that will have all these groups as part of the destination list where it will post over time.<\/p>\n<p>A good option is to have as many groups as possible and not to post to the same groups over and over so that your content and website don&#8217;t look spammy.<\/p>\n<p>You can set your When to Publish tab to post to 10 random destinations from your destination list per day. That means that one post-list item will be posted to 10 niche-related groups from this profile on that day. Note that your campaign will first go through all available groups on the destination list and then start a<br \/>\nnew circle.<\/p>\n<p>For better results, you can create multiple different accounts that will all join different groups and post from different profiles to these groups. This way each of your posts will be able to be viewed by more people that belong to your target audience.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/standard-campaign-1024x417.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"803\" height=\"327\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you have any additional questions related to any of the mentioned tools, please don\u2019t hesitate to <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/contact\/\">contact Jarvee customer support<\/a>.
