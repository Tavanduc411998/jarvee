Their power to affect their respective industries is undeniable. This makes them on top of your priority list.<\/p>\n<p>Industry influencers usually have a large social media following. They are active in responding to interactions in social media. You can also see they are also actively engaged in their own sites via the replies they give to comments and shares they post.<\/p>\n<p>They help you with your Twitter conversions by sending traffic to your account. This eventually influences the decisions of your target audience. This influence also expands to your potential consumers, those who you have not reached before but are tapped by the influencers.<\/p>\n<p>When they retweet your tweets or mention you in a tweet, this could help increase your Twitter conversions. In order to achieve that, you must first find the right ones to connect with. There are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.razorsocial.com\/find-influencers-twitter\/\">several apps<\/a> that will help you find power users on Twitter. Regardless of the tool you use, you need to check for those who update their profile regularly and connect with their followers.<\/p>\n<p>Next, build rapport with your identified influencers. Engage in conversation with them by mentioning them in a tweet. You can make recommendations for updates they might find interesting. You can also retweet their updates or write about something that the influencers tweeted. If they asked a question or solicited a suggestion, you can give your best response. If it takes more than 140 characters to give your response, create a blog post. Remember to embed their tweet and mention them in your post.<\/p>\n<p>Share your blog posts with them. Make sure that you are up-to-date with the latest news and trends in your industry. You may also offer to guest post on their blog.
