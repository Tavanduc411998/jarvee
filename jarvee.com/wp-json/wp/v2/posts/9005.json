The more quality links your website has, the more chances it has to rank higher on the Search Engine Results Page (SERP). But what if you didn\u2019t have to work on getting links.

Instead of <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.process.st\/content-optimization\/\">creating excellent content<\/a><\/u> and waiting for someone to link to you, these link magnets will incentivize other websites to link to you. It\u2019s a great way to attract quality links, drive traffic to your website and rank higher on search engines.<\/p>\n<p>They help you <u><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.lemlist.com\/how-to-get-backlinks\/\">generate more links<\/a><\/u> organically with minimal outreach. This saves time and helps get links from sites that normally wouldn\u2019t link to you.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we\u2019ll discuss five types of link magnets that can help skyrocket your SEO. Let\u2019s dive in!<\/p>\n<h2>5 types of link magnets you can use to earn quality links<\/h2>\n<p>Building a link acquisition strategy is a routine aspect of SEO optimization. However, link magnets take a different route and attract quality links by providing websites with a solid reason to link to you. Let\u2019s see how you can do this for your website:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Write outstanding blog posts<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s no doubt that well-written blog posts get linked to the most. It\u2019s one of the most organic and authentic ways to drive links to your website and rank higher. Think about this, you\u2019re writing a blog post on a topic, and you come across another blog post that has some great information that adds more context to what you\u2019re saying in your blog- wouldn\u2019t you want to link to it?<\/p>\n<p>The end motive of a blog post is to add value to the reader and solve their problems. With that in mind, linking provides the readers with an authoritative source of information that can help clarify the topic in a much clearer sense. To develop a well-written blog everyone wants to link to, here\u2019s what you can do:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide in-depth information about the topic and answer the most common questions. You can do this by combining different sources of information beyond the first page of Google. Research YouTube, social media, and take surveys to accommodate a broader perspective in the blog.<\/li>\n<li>Provide <u><a href=\"https:\/\/qodeinteractive.com\/qi-addons-for-elementor\/image-gallery\/\">visual treats<\/a><\/u> in the blog with checklists and images that can add more context to your words.<\/li>\n<li>Take opinions and quotes from experts to make the content more credible.<\/li>\n<li>You can also <u><a href=\"https:\/\/smartemailtrends.com\/email-marketing-statistics\/\">include statistics<\/a><\/u> by carrying out research and surveys- another reason for them to link to you.<\/li>\n<li>Structure it in the right way to enhance readability and reading experience.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>2. Infographics<\/h3>\n<p>These are visual explanations for a particular topic with minimal text that allow readers to consume information quickly and easily. With the help of graphics and structures, infographics enhance comprehension and break down complex concepts into digestible content.<\/p>\n<p>You can attract quite some links by including infographics on your website or embedding them in Google images. The key is to address a common problem relatable to your target audience and business. Include your brand colors and some exciting visuals to complement the text and make it irresistible.<\/p>\n<p>For an idea, let\u2019s say you want to <u><a href=\"https:\/\/stellarseo.com\/law-firm-seo-guide\/\">improve your law firm&#8217;s SEO<\/a><\/u>. You need to start with some research to see what types of law-related tips and stats catch your audience\u2019s attention. You should conduct this research on both social media and search engines.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9008\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/infographic-example.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"745\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/infographic-example.png 1180w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/infographic-example-262x300.png 262w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/infographic-example-894x1024.png 894w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/infographic-example-768x880.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/infographic-example-600x687.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can then amass all of them into an infographic as <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hockerlawfirm.com\/why-you-should-hire-attorney-infographic\">Hocker Law did here<\/a><\/u>. You represent tips with illustrations and statistics with graphs.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Income reports or statistics<\/h3>\n<p>Content, rich in numbers, be it statistics or income reports, earn many links because they\u2019re from a credible source and validate the point someone is trying to make on the Internet. Here\u2019s what they look like:<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9007\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9007\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-9007 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/income-report.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"530\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/income-report.png 500w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/income-report-283x300.png 283w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-9007\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">credit to <a href=\"https:\/\/robcubbon.com\/blog-income-reports\/\">source<\/a><\/p><\/div>\n<p>If you just say that freelancers in the US earn an average of $60 per hour, it may not hold much weight. But if you link the same number to a unique income report you create, it will look a lot more credible. Others will link to it too.<\/p>\n<p>The report should include income statistics that websites can cite on their website, giving you an organic backlink.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Unique case studies<\/h3>\n<p>Case studies provide a detailed analysis of a business, person, or subject. It\u2019s a great way to help people gather practical insights into otherwise theoretical practices and ideologies. This what a <u><a href=\"https:\/\/venngage.com\/blog\/case-study-examples\/\">case study looks like<\/a><\/u>:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9006\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/case-study-example.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"424\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/case-study-example.png 1920w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/case-study-example-300x196.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/case-study-example-1024x668.png 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/case-study-example-768x501.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/case-study-example-600x391.png 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/case-study-example-1536x1002.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If someone tells you SEO can help you drive over 60,000 unique visitors per month, you may not believe it. But, if a website brings out a case study explaining how they achieved this using various methods, you\u2019ll gain confidence in their statement.<\/p>\n<p>Creating case studies on unique topics can help earn quality links because it helps people understand more about a topic and how it performs in a practical, real-world scenario.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Embeddable quiz results<\/h3>\n<p>Quizzes test people on their knowledge about a particular subject. These can be embedded on a landing page or a website with results to show people the answers to essential questions in the quiz. These questions can be unique and uncommon for your audience so they will want to take part<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9009\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9009\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-9009\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/quiz.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"378\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/quiz.png 918w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/quiz-300x175.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/quiz-768x447.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/quiz-600x349.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-9009\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">credit to <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.moodle.org\/310\/en\/Embedded_Answers_(Cloze)_question_type\">source<\/a><\/p><\/div>\n<p>The best way to do this would be to pick up a less-explored topic, create a quiz around it, and embed it on your website. Formulate it so that people see a grade at the end. You can then ask them to embed the grade on their website. Make sure you insert a link back to your website in this embed code.<\/p>\n<p>Many will gladly embed the link. You can get a ton of backlinks with this strategy. But inform them about the backlink in the code. As some people might not like it if you\u2019re discreet.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Link magnets are a lesser-known yet effective way to attract good-quality links to your website. Since <a href=\"https:\/\/seobuddy.com\/link-chest\">link building<\/a> is an essential aspect of SEO, these five content types are worth trying to provide an incentive for websites to link to you.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a great way to work around SEO optimization without directly manipulating search engines, yet getting considerable results by acquiring links.<\/p>\n<p>More than link building, it can also open doors to new opportunities for collaborations and rankings. It\u2019s a critical aspect for SEO and can take your website to a whole new level with more traffic and higher rankings.<\/p>\n<p>It can also save time and money as you\u2019ll require less outreach.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Author<\/h3>\n<p>Rachel Bowland is a content editor at <u><a href=\"https:\/\/creatiwitt.com\/\">Creatiwitt<\/a><\/u> who likes to write about marketing and design.
