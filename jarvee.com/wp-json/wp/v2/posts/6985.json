Yes, Instagram Stories are a much more candid way that you can interact with your audience, which is why most influencers take to Instagram to promote their brand, grow their personality, etc.<\/p>\n<p>However, just because Instagram Stories can be a great marketing tool for most, doesn\u2019t mean that anything and everything that you post are acceptable. In fact, Stories has its own tricks and methods that help users and influencers maximize their potential. In order to find out these tricks and methods, it takes testing them out and determining which ones work with your audience, and which ones don\u2019t. And, it\u2019s okay to make mistakes, as you learn the ropes.<\/p>\n<p>Here are five of the most common mistakes that you might make on Instagram Stories, and how you can fix them.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/5-Mistakes-You\u2019ll-Make-On-Instagram-Stories.jpg\" alt=\"5 Mistakes You\u2019ll Make On Instagram Stories\" width=\"613\" height=\"375\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6986\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/5-Mistakes-You\u2019ll-Make-On-Instagram-Stories.jpg 613w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/5-Mistakes-You\u2019ll-Make-On-Instagram-Stories-300x184.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/5-Mistakes-You\u2019ll-Make-On-Instagram-Stories-600x367.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>1. Inconsistency<\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes, a brand will get so immersed into the idea of <a href=\"https:\/\/sproutsocial.com\/insights\/instagram-stories\/\">promoting products and events on Instagram Stories<\/a>, that they immediately dive into it head-first into uncharted waters, posting anything and everything on their profile. But before you dive in, understand first that it takes time to find the right look for your brand on Stories.<\/p>\n<p>You have to have consistency, in order to make Stories work for you. Your brand\u2019s aesthetic is very important in this case, because it shows people who you are and what you do. Even when you\u2019ve got various social and community media managers publishing posts and promotions, you\u2019ll have to educate them on how to make Stories effective for your brand, and have a pre-agreed plan for your tone of voice and how the imagery and copy should look and feel.<\/p>\n<p>Consider the following objectives, when thinking about consistency:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you want the text all caps or standard?<\/li>\n<li>What kind of color(s) will you use? Do the colors tie into your brand\u2019s palette?<\/li>\n<li>Do you want text blocking, a full-color block, semi-transparent color block, or no blocking?<\/li>\n<li>Is your brand okay with you using emojis and drawings?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Inconsistency-in-your-Instagram-Story.jpg\" alt=\"Inconsistency in your Instagram Story\" width=\"473\" height=\"631\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6987\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Inconsistency-in-your-Instagram-Story.jpg 473w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Inconsistency-in-your-Instagram-Story-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>2. Trying To Break Down A Narrative<\/h2>\n<p>Narrative breakdowns can turn disastrous, especially <a href=\"https:\/\/later.com\/blog\/product-launch-social-media\/\">when using InstaStories to try and cover a live event<\/a>. Sometimes, users and influencers have that bad habit of publishing their first Instagram Story video or images (e.g. Showing off the venue), and sometime later publishing the next part of the story (e.g. The guests slowly showing up to the event) and then publishing another part of the story, and so on. Breaking down the narrative in such a way will only make your story feel disjointed every time a user tries to go back and watch the next piece.<\/p>\n<p>The takeaway here is that you don\u2019t have to shove parts of the story out the door in an immediate time frame because an event is Live. Instead, try to have the first three or four pieces of your story captured first before publishing them together as a set, so that your viewers are treated to a coherent story.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Trying-To-Break-Down-A-Narrative.jpg\" alt=\"Trying To Break Down A Narrative\" width=\"400\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6988\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Trying-To-Break-Down-A-Narrative.jpg 400w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Trying-To-Break-Down-A-Narrative-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>3. Focusing On Multiple Things At Once<\/h2>\n<p>As mentioned above, consistency is key in Stories. Although it\u2019s tempting to post little fragments of everything that\u2019s going on at your brand, what\u2019ll leave a much bigger impact on your viewers is if you stick to showing them one thing at a time.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you want to <a href=\"https:\/\/later.com\/blog\/product-launch-social-media\/\">show off a new product<\/a>, then you can use Stories to show the packaging, the feature, give a demonstration on said product, and talk about the special offers that come with it. Doing this lets you focus on one thing, and that one thing only in that Story\u2019s 24-hour lifespan.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t stress out in having to show multiple products in one day. Remember that there\u2019s always tomorrow to promote another product.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Providing-An-Interactive-Experience.jpg\" alt=\"Providing An Interactive Experience\" width=\"501\" height=\"750\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6989\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Providing-An-Interactive-Experience.jpg 501w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Providing-An-Interactive-Experience-200x300.jpg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>4. Not Providing An Interactive Experience<\/h2>\n<p>With Stories, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/business.instagram.com\/blog\/a-step-by-step-guide-create-playful-and-interactive-instagram-stories?locale=en_GB\">provide an interactive experience<\/a> for your viewers. Not bringing them into the experience will only cause a disconnect between you and (what could\u2019ve been) your potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>Interaction means that you should do more than just post a still image of a product that you\u2019re trying to selling. Instead, try filming an unboxing video, where you build up the anticipation as you show and open up the product packaging, and putting the product to use afterward. As you\u2019re filming, remember to communicate to the viewers directly, and say what you like about your product.<\/p>\n<p>Interested in knowing your followers\u2019 opinions? No problem! Throwing in polls and swipe meters let viewers vote on products and suggestions based on how they feel towards them. Videos and on-screen voting tools help you create a more interactive experiences with your audience.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Instagram-Stories-creativity.jpg\" alt=\"Instagram Stories creativity\" width=\"608\" height=\"405\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6990\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Instagram-Stories-creativity.jpg 608w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Instagram-Stories-creativity-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Instagram-Stories-creativity-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>5. Lack Of Creativity<\/h2>\n<p>Instagram Stories isn\u2019t Instagram Stories without creativity. The whole point of Stories is to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/instagram-story-ideas\/\">create exciting promotions and experiences<\/a> for your audience.<\/p>\n<p>Although you don\u2019t have to post live events or product demos all the time, you can still try to come up with other ways to make things social. You could offer discount codes and coupons to viewers who screenshot it or record their response on an on-screen poll that you might set up.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, one of the latest trends right now are boomerangs, which are a fun method of adding movement to your Stories. Boomerangs tend to set themselves up for you in automatically animating the single simple motion you create, so there\u2019s no need for further editing or tweaking. Plus, it only adds motion to a short amount of film that you want reversed and repeated. For example, a person jumping into the water should like them yo-yoing in and out of the water. Forcing Boomerangs to work (or trying to time it correctly) will only make it look jumpy and unpolished. To do it correctly depends on knowing what you want to show.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/conclusion-to-instagram-stories.jpg\" alt=\"conclusion to instagram stories\" width=\"631\" height=\"420\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6991\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/conclusion-to-instagram-stories.jpg 631w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/conclusion-to-instagram-stories-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/conclusion-to-instagram-stories-600x399.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 631px) 100vw, 631px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s okay to make these mistakes on your first try, but as you continue to dabble into Instagram Stories, and see what does work and what doesn\u2019t, you\u2019ll be on your way to promoting your brand, driving sales, and gaining loyal followers for many years to come.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the author<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Molly Crockett writes for <a href=\"https:\/\/bigassignments.com\/professional-assignment-writers\"><em>Bigassignments<\/em><\/a><em> and <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/oxessays.com\/write-my-essay\"><em>Oxessays<\/em><\/a><em>.
