					<description><![CDATA[Without call to action you basically wasted your video. Great vloggers are able to keep you interested till the end of the video so that they call you to do some action. They even mention you to stay till the end of the video, because something great will happen or something similar.]]></description>

If youtube finds out that you&#039;ve been stuffing keywords to manipulate their algorithm, your video will get penalized. 

But you can try not to &#039; stuff &#039; it and have a 1-2% keyword density. Best is to split test and check.]]></description>

It all depends on the type of channel. You can have a combination of both, however, avoid being too clickbaity as people will call you out and that can be a disaster!]]></description>
