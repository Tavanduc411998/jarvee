These carts may be kept by your customers for future purposes or they\u2019re totally abandoned, never to be bought again. From your perspective as the business owner, you shouldn\u2019t consider the abandoned cart as a negative thing. Rather, you should see it as an opportunity of a potential customer worth pursuing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to your Shopify store\u2014or any other <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbescommunicationscouncil\/2020\/06\/11\/four-simple-hacks-for-driving-traffic-to-your-e-commerce-website\/?sh=78bde5e35048\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">e-commerce website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for that matter\u2014there are many reasons for shopping cart abandonment. Some can be due to a sudden emergency, a text message or phone call they had to address, which made them forget the shopping cart, or perhaps spur-of-the-moment decisions where, in the end, the potential buyer decided not to push through with the buy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most likely, however, abandoned carts may be due to some unpleasant kink the customer must\u2019ve gone through in their buyer journey, which shaped their decision to not check out what\u2019s in their shopping cart. To start with, you can use these simple fixes, as discussed <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.jivochat.com\/blog\/sales\/shopify-plugins.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in this post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, to reduce the abandonment rate of carts on your Shopify e-commerce store and increase sales:<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h2><b>1. Reduce Checkout Fears<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/356122\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">online shopping<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> seems the way to go these days, this doesn\u2019t mean that the fears associated with online shopping are no longer present. Generally, those fears are centered on data security, as buyers want to feel assured they aren\u2019t compromising their confidential information. So it falls on your shoulders to ensure all those checkout fears are reduced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally, you\u2019ll want to limit the personal information your store is asking. If it isn\u2019t relevant to complete a purchase, then don\u2019t ask for it. If you do have to ask for specific information, be sure to provide the justification why you\u2019re asking for that specific information. An example is when you ask for an alternate phone number. To convince shoppers this is necessary, you may want to add a disclosure that the phone number is needed in the event the primary number can\u2019t be reached, just to ensure the order will be delivered.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, you should also add a general disclosure in your checkout process that whatever personal information you\u2019ve put in won\u2019t be saved and will be only used to complete the purchase and nothing else.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<h2><b>2. Simplify Your Checkout Process<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t assume that just because an individual is shopping online, they\u2019re tech-savvy. More often than not, many shoppers only know the basics, and they\u2019re shopping online for the convenience it brings. Thus, it makes perfect sense to also make your checkout process as easy and convenient as possible. If there are any complicated elements in the process, most of the time, this can irritate a potential buyer and would be more inclined to leave the cart and your website instead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some of the best strategies to apply, to keep your checkout process simple and keep your customers happy:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Use Clear Product Images And Descriptions: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should make your customer feel as though they\u2019re shopping in a physical store where they know exactly what they\u2019re getting from simply looking at your <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-to-write-product-descriptions-to-increase-sales-on-social-media\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">product images and descriptions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Don\u2019t Require Registration: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is because many online shoppers still prefer to check out as guests. Not many online shoppers like to register to a lot of online shops, especially if it\u2019s still their first time buying from a Shopify store.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Test Checking Out: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Put yourself in the customer\u2019s perspective. If there\u2019s anything you\u2019re unhappy about with your checkout process, then take note of it and make the necessary tweaks. Often, there\u2019s no better way for you to understand your customers than to experience what happens to them yourself.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>3. Partner With Speedy Shipping Options<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customers today are still very particular about the cost. But for those who shop online, many are willing to pay a tad more for quick shipping. So, you have to provide that option to your customers. Many would abandon their carts when the shipping options aren\u2019t fast enough. They may need the items ASAP, so they\u2019re abandoning their cart in favor of other Shopify stores with faster shipping. Or they may not be patient enough to wait that long, so they\u2019d rather just shop from a physical store instead.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, you\u2019ll want to offer at least three to four shipping options on your checkout. Alongside the shipping cost, be sure to also include the estimate of how long it\u2019ll take for your orders to arrive, so you\u2019re giving your customers different options. This can give them more room to decide on what\u2019s favorable to them, rather than leave their cart and your site completely.<\/span><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9829 \" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Cart-Abandonment-1024x683.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"799\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Cart-Abandonment-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Cart-Abandonment-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Cart-Abandonment-768x512.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Cart-Abandonment-600x400.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Cart-Abandonment-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Cart-Abandonment-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><b>4. Offer Multiple Payment Options<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with offering multiple shipping options, it\u2019s also a good idea to offer multiple payment options. Not many like using or sharing their debit and credit card info, as some do still think <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/personalfinance\/2017\/06\/14\/11-reasons-why-cash-still-king\/102778034\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cash is king<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Alternatively, some buyers may also prefer more secure payment channels like PayPal, Payoneer, among others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The whole point here is to make sure your Shopify store has enough payment options to cater to your customers\u2019 needs. The more options you have, the lesser the chances of a shopper abandoning their cart simply because their preferred checkout option is unavailable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip: <\/strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> To deal with cart abandonment rates correctly, you also need to collect data about such cases. It&#8217;ll help you to track how effective the approaches described above were for you. To do that, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coupler.io\/bigquery-integrations\/shopify-to-bigquery\">move data from Shopify to BigQuery<\/a>. You&#8217;ll have abandoned orders in one place, get insights, and be able to maintain lower the cart abandonment rate of your store based on the data provided. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the emphasis on online shopping nowadays, there\u2019s no denying that the competition is also getting a lot stiffer. While many consumers turn toward online shopping, consequently, many eCommerce websites powered by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/collection\/time100-companies\/5950028\/shopify\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shopify<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are also popping out. This means shoppers have more options to choose from and are getting more meticulous in their decision-making process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Essentially, you have to provide a pleasant journey on your website\u2014else, you may lose your potential buyers or have them abandon their carts. If you notice your Shopify store suddenly having high abandonment rates, then that should be a sign for you to focus on refining the checkout process.
