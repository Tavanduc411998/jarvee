Make personable customer transactions and interactions.<\/h2>\n<p>Shoppers today crave interactive connections with the brands they already love and are still beginning to explore.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re one of those brands, give your customers unique, personable shopping experiences and post-purchase follow-ups.<\/p>\n<p>But how do you do that?<\/p>\n<p>One of the most effective ways to bond with your customers is to slip in a handwritten note in the product packaging. It could be a thank you note or anything at all that makes your customers happy as they read it. Personalized <a href=\"https:\/\/www.handwrytten.com\/\">handwritten notes<\/a> are something to remember you by, and they can really forge a strong relationship with your customers for future transactions.<\/p>\n<p>Now let\u2019s consider emails, for instance.<\/p>\n<p>Refrain from sending unbranded, transactional emails with only standard purchase information (e.g., delivery dates and confirmation numbers).<\/p>\n<p>While these emails are practical and important, they sorely lack a memorable personality of your brand. The result? You lose vital engagement opportunities and diminish your brand\u2019s value to customers.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, apply personalization tactics such as inserting attractive digital signatures into your messages &#8212; especially <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartkarrot.com\/resources\/blog\/customer-success-email\/\">customer service emails<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Doing that shows customers they\u2019re interacting with a real person, makes them feel valued, and causes you to look authentic. It then becomes easier to get their trust and patronage.<\/p>\n<p>An excellent tool for creating your digital signature is WiseStamp, which has a free, handy, and user-friendly signature generator. Here\u2019s how it looks like:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9794 \" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/wisestamp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"658\" height=\"438\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/wisestamp.png 512w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/wisestamp-300x200.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Draw your signature with your mouse, touchscreen, or touchpad, customize the color, and enable the option for a transparent background (if you wish).<\/p>\n<p>To redo your signature or delete it, WiseStamp also offers those options at the bottom right. Once you\u2019re done, you can download or add it to your email signature:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9795 \" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/wisestamp-signoff.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"673\" height=\"280\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/wisestamp-signoff.png 512w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/wisestamp-signoff-300x125.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Email personalization also includes mentioning your shoppers\u2019 names, greeting them on their birthdays, sending thank-you, cart abandonment, and welcome messages, and recommending products based on their interests.<\/p>\n<p>Adopting a lively, appreciative voice even in your pop-ups for email subscriptions, flash sales, coupon giveaways, event invitations, etc., works for personable approaches.<\/p>\n<p>You can achieve that through platforms modernizing email marketing with behavioral targeting and other personalization features (often powered by automation and artificial intelligence or AI). Just make sure that your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.emailvendorselection.com\/free-cheap-email-marketing-software-comparison\/\">email marketing software<\/a> integrates with these platforms easily. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sendinblue.com\/\">Sendinblue email marketing software<\/a> can be your best bet when it comes to hassle-free integration.<\/p>\n<p>These platforms can remember and intelligently analyze buyers\u2019 behaviors and preferences and deliver shopping experiences tailored for them.<\/p>\n<p>Besides adding handwritten notes and emails, you can also humanize other aspects of your buyer interaction. Examples include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Creating omnichannel buying experiences<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Inviting customers to post purchases on social media and reposting their content on your site and social pages;<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Upsell in easygoing and not forceful, salesy ways, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Personable experiences like this make your eCommerce brand stand out and appeal to your customers.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Modernize your order fulfillment processes through automation.<\/h2>\n<p>One of the best practices for purchase order management is automation. Why? Because it streamlines your operations and helps you process purchases faster.<\/p>\n<p>Automation also helps you lessen the possibility of human error and frees up your time for other core business activities.<\/p>\n<p>That said, use modern purchasing software systems (which often have automation features) that suit your eCommerce business structure and operations.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, the tools\u2019 cutting-edge AI algorithms can closely track and analyze your overall purchase order and procurement workflow, including every order\u2019s particular data points.<\/p>\n<p>The AI then rapidly extracts these data sets and reviews any inaccuracies. This enhances your efficiency in controlling supply chain costs and understanding of your business expenses.<\/p>\n<p>Harnessing automation- and AI-powered order fulfillment systems simplifies your procurement, purchasing, and payment processes &#8212; both on your business\u2019 and customers\u2019 end.<\/p>\n<p>This leads to enhanced shopping experiences that satisfy your buyers and set your brand apart.<\/p>\n<p>You can also couple these tools with <a href=\"https:\/\/theecommmanager.com\/warehouse-management-systems-software\/\">warehouse management systems<\/a> and supply chain management software. Doing so lets you address more comprehensive matters affecting your order fulfillment tasks and processes.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Use eye-catching, impressive online store designs.<\/h2>\n<p>According to statistics from Kissmetrics, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.kissmetrics.com\/color-psychology\/\">nearly 95% of buyers<\/a> say they value visual appearance over any other elements when shopping online.<\/p>\n<p>This shows how high-quality web design helps skyrocket your business performance. One reason is it helps your eCommerce store stand out from other sites.<\/p>\n<p>Although beautiful, brand-specific designs often call for a considerable investment, it\u2019s worth taking because of its massive potential returns in sales and customer loyalty, among others.<\/p>\n<p>Millie\u2019s shows a stunning example:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9796 \" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/online-store-designs.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"749\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/online-store-designs.png 512w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/online-store-designs-300x146.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Their pretty, uber-colorful homepage stimulates your visual senses (and taste buds) and makes you feel light-hearted and cheery &#8212; aligning with their business\u2019 brand personality.<\/p>\n<p>Like Millie\u2019s, design your eCommerce store in a way that makes visitors love you, at first sight, remember you, and want to keep coming back.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s another example by Recess:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-9797 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/eye-catching-design-300x146.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"341\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/eye-catching-design-300x146.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/eye-catching-design.png 512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Recess employs a colorful yet minimalist design to represent the calm, cool and collected vibe its brand and products evoke. It even designed the site creatively with micro animations from top to bottom.<\/p>\n<p>This makes their site and brand amusing, visually appealing, and distinct &#8212; enticing visitors to return and become loyal customers.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Turn your buyers into philanthropists.<\/h2>\n<p>People feel good when they do something that benefits society.<\/p>\n<p>Leverage that by weaving charitable initiatives into your eCommerce business and inviting your customers to get involved.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s one way to do it: for every purchase from your eCommerce store, a portion of it goes to any society-benefiting activity or community.<\/p>\n<p>When you do that, more potential buyers, especially the cause-driven ones, are likely to flock to your shop and patronize your brand among the rest.<\/p>\n<p>Not all eCommerce stores do it, so using this strategy solidifies your brand and sets you above your rivals.<\/p>\n<p>Other charitable or advocacy-oriented initiatives you can do are obtaining your products\u2019 design and materials from local, indigenous, and sustainable sources, just labor, and fairly acknowledged intellectual property.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, consider telling interesting stories to give your audience more insight into the company they\u2019re dealing with.<\/p>\n<p>When done right, <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/marketing-storytelling-key-tips-to-tell-interesting-stories\/\">marketing storytelling<\/a> can be a great way to connect and engage with your audience while sparking their interest in your brand and your offer.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Build your store\u2019s own mobile app.<\/h2>\n<p>Creating an app for your eCommerce store boosts your brand visibility and recognition in the marketplace. Your app can reinforce what makes you stand out, engage more shoppers, and bolster customer patronage. Statistics even show that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/consumer-insights\/consumer-trends\/mobile-shopping-brand-decision-statistics\/\">59% of buyers<\/a> consider the option to purchase on mobile a crucial factor for brand selection.<\/p>\n<p>To set your brand apart, invite more shoppers, and prove yourself worth selecting, develop your app with a stellar user experience. It should have features such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Smooth navigation and interface. Make your app\u2019s destinations quick to access (applying as few screen taps as possible) and easy on the eyes. Putting negative space and using readable font styles can help achieve this.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Quick login and checkout. Apply options to log in via email or social networks or offer auto-complete features (ask first for permission to store information), so users don\u2019t need to fill in their credentials manually every time. Have a seamless checkout as well by minimizing unnecessary steps.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Brand consistency. Display your branding identity elements in the same manner throughout your app (and other channels). Keep a stylebook so you don\u2019t lose track of your store\u2019s predefined colors, typeface, image and photo styles, etc., (or similar).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now, building your brand doesn\u2019t stop at developing your app. To maintain your positive reputation, you have to maintain its security from threats such as hacking, system malfunction, and accidental deletion. Remember, losing your code and data can destroy your bottom line and customer relationships, land you in hot legal water, and even shut down your business.<\/p>\n<p>Secure your app by backing up your code and data frequently. If you built your app with Microsoft Azure DevOps, use automated backup tools such as <a href=\"https:\/\/backrightup.com\">Backrightup<\/a> (designed specifically for Azure DevOps).<\/p>\n<p>Every day, Backrightup instantly duplicates your pipelines, wikis, work items, etc., and sends updates on your dashboard. With this tool, you won\u2019t have to worry about securing your app and performing this time-consuming task. You can instead focus better on executing your brand strategy.<\/p>\n<h2>Set your eCommerce business brand apart.<\/h2>\n<p>No matter your niche, you need to set your eCommerce store apart from your rivals by nailing your branding in the head.<\/p>\n<p>If bolstering your eCommerce brand sounds daunting to you, start slow and small, but be deliberate and optimistic. Take your time in carefully building a concentrated, sales-driving brand strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Through these and other techniques, you can create a likable, memorable brand and be better positioned for lasting success in the eCommerce space.<\/p>\n<h2>Author&#8217;s Bio<\/h2>\n<p>Jimmy is a freelance writer and the owner of the GuildofBloggers.com.
