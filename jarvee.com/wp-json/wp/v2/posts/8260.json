With the meteoric rise of social media, influencers have gained a massive following among the masses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Platforms like YouTube and<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-to-become-instagram-famous-10-expert-tips-from-real-time-influencer\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Instagram are littered with influencers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that provide brands the opportunity to connect with hundreds of thousands of people. From shampoos and skin-care products to gaming and book reviews, influencer marketing is catching up and enabling brands to develop active communities. These communities purchase products and services and also bring numerous referrals by spreading good word-of-mouth.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although influencer marketing has various benefits, companies often find it challenging to execute successful influencer marketing campaigns. They often get confused about whom to approach, how to begin the campaign, and how to measure the success of the campaign?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This article describes the nitty-gritty of an influencer marketing campaign and how you can build one from scratch.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What is Influencer Marketing?<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8261 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/influencer-marketing.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/influencer-marketing.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/influencer-marketing-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/influencer-marketing-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/influencer-marketing-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At its core, influencer marketing is all about exposing the company&#8217;s offering \u2014 products and services \u2014 to a broad audience through the influencer. Companies need to start by identifying influencers who have a massive following in their respective industry and exercise command over their followers&#8217; minds and hearts. A survey conducted by Annalect and Twitter shows that 49% of the respondents depend on social media influencers for product recommendations. Moreover, 40% of the respondents said they purchased a product only because they saw the influencer using it on <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">social media<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> platforms. That&#8217;s a considerable number, and companies wouldn&#8217;t like to miss the significant exposure and engagement they can get by tying up with influencers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies should keep in mind that an influencer is not always a celebrity who has millions of followers but someone who dominates a niche. Your goal shouldn&#8217;t be reaching as many people as possible but getting the right audience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&#8217;s talk in detail about finding the right influencer for your brand and the steps necessary for creating an influencer marketing strategy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Steps to create an Influencer Marketing Strategy<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8262 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/marketing-objectives.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"531\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/marketing-objectives.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/marketing-objectives-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/marketing-objectives-768x510.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/marketing-objectives-600x398.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Lay down the objective neatly<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like every other marketing campaign, it&#8217;s essential to jot down what you want to achieve by running an influencer marketing campaign.

Start by creating a buyer persona to understand your client base and then strategize accordingly.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Find the right influencer<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you know your target audience, you can begin your search for <a href=\"https:\/\/shanebarker.com\/blog\/detailed-strategy-find-right-influencers-for-your-business\/#:~:text=The%20easiest%20way%20of%20finding,So%2C%20look%20out%20for%20those.\">finding the right influencer<\/a>. The following list will shed light on the various kinds of influencers whom you can approach:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Social media stars<\/li>\n<li>Movie Celebrities<\/li>\n<li>Bloggers<\/li>\n<li>Industry experts<\/li>\n<li>Loyal fans<\/li>\n<li>People who become celebrities overnight<\/li>\n<li>Though leaders<\/li>\n<li>Non-competing brands<\/li>\n<li>Institutes of international importance<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also search for influencers based on topics and backlinks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Prepare metrics to rate your influencer<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It feels great to begin your journey to find the right influencer for your brand. But you need some metrics to rate their performance. Here is a list of metrics you should keep in mind before zeroing in on an influencer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>a. What kind of audience does the influencer has?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s essential to check what kind of audience the influencer interacts with. A smaller audience that exactly matches your ideal market is better than a broader audience that doesn&#8217;t. Critically analyze the influencer&#8217;s audience by visiting their website. One of the ways to get these insights is to use AI Powered ERP Software to visualize trends and get insights about what kind of people consume the influencer&#8217;s content.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following are some data points that ERP software can capture:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Traffic source type<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Impressions<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Watch time<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Engagement rate<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Past brand collaborations<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Positive or negative comments<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Audience type<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proceed forward with the influencer only if you feel that their audience is the right fit for your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>b. How much engagement does the influencer get?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you know the kind of audience that consumes the influencer&#8217;s content, it&#8217;s imperative to find the level of engagement the influencer gets. Run through their social media handles and check how many likes, shares, and comments they receive on average. Don&#8217;t forget to inspect the number of subscribers the influencer has.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For blog posts and website, focus on metrics such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Number of views<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Number of visitors<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Bounce rate<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Number of backlinks<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Search engine rankings<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Average time spent on site<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the influencer&#8217;s reach is limited and falls below your set threshold, consider searching for someone else. It doesn&#8217;t make sense to invest your marketing dollars in something that doesn&#8217;t guarantee a meaningful return.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>c. What kind of content does the influencer create?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/2019\/09\/content-creation-essentials\/\">Content creation<\/a> is the last but undoubtedly the most significant out of all metrics discussed above. As a company, you should collaborate with only those influencers who speak your language. If the influencer&#8217;s target market is very different from yours, you should avoid associating your brand with them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following points will shed light on what you should keep in mind while examining the influencer&#8217;s content:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Is the content relevant to your brand, products, and services?<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Does the content wield power to influence the audience to purchase the product?<\/li>\n<li>Is the content aligned to your brand&#8217;s mission, vision, and values, or does it drift away?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the answers to all the above questions are a resounding yes, don&#8217;t hesitate to associate with the influencer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The digital uprising has given birth to numerous content creators that have become prominent influencers. They wield power to shape their audience&#8217;s purchasing pattern. Companies realize the importance of these new-age influencers and how profitable they can be for them. This is why businesses across industries associate with influencers to leverage the latter&#8217;s popularity to sell their offerings. This article taught you the essential things you should keep in mind while selecting influencers. Right influencers can help you reach the right audience. In contrast, a wrong influencer can make a dent in your brand&#8217;s image.
