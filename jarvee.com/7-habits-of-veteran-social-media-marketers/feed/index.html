					<description><![CDATA[These kind of people are making a brand out of themselves. They are young in spirit and very flexible to learn new things, switch methods, and meet new people from the industry. I know a few of them and they are really that kind of people that you can admire and learn from them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would say that habit of all genuinely successful people is that they are willing to help other to succeed as well. This way they are at the same time doing something good for other and they can expect good in return. This way they are being connected with more and more people that can have only good words for them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing! Interesting read  Well, I believe that in order to know what you want you actually need some experience in life and in social media as well.

					<description><![CDATA[One of the things in my experience, and as you guys have too pointed out, is that the veterans seriously know how to communicate well. It&#039;s kind of logical that they HAVE to know how to communicate since marketing is basically communications. But one can easily spot the noob from the veteran from the style of their explanation]]></description>
