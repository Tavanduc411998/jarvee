SEO is no longer simply about using the right keywords, it\u2019s also about having the right people using them to aid in your quest for credibility and publicity. While it might look like social media marketing is generated mainly towards sales and exposure, there are a few ways that these influencers can boost a company\u2019s SEO growth and it\u2019s all in the interest of the company\u2019s brand.<\/p>\n<h3>1.\u00a0\u00a0 Strengthening and diversifying a website\u2019s backlink profile<\/h3>\n<p>As an SEO expert, <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reputio.com\/anchor-text-optimization\/\">you would know that keyword stuffing<\/a><\/u> and pay for links might give you the same kind of boost you would get from buying Instagram followers, it isn\u2019t sustainable in the long run because Google algorithms are forever changing and evolving in order to adapt to the latest trends in user exploitation. While it may work for the short term, it is not something that you can employ over a longer duration. However, social media influencers can offer something that most advertising agencies are unable to afford: diversification.<\/p>\n<p>On one hand, social media influencers can help build a <u><a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/search-ranking-factors\">site\u2019s ranking<\/a><\/u> in a multitude of ways. Most of them have their own websites or guest posts in high domain sites and when they link to their client\u2019s website, their client instantly benefits from the link juice. They are also on multiple platforms, which means that you will be getting linkbacks on high-profile social media accounts which will also count for something. As long as someone is talking about your brand, it generates trust with search engines and will increase the likelihood of your business getting more visibility.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, social media influencers are the celebrities of the twenty-first century. Large publications and fans alike will take note of what they are talking about and talk about it too, which also creates an echo effect, whereby the client\u2019s link will be bounced around organically. You can expect to benefit from this in ways that you will not be able to obtain through traditional means of SEO marketing or strategies.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9854\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Achieving-unique-and-high-quality-content-through-social-media-influencers.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"416\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Achieving-unique-and-high-quality-content-through-social-media-influencers.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Achieving-unique-and-high-quality-content-through-social-media-influencers-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Achieving-unique-and-high-quality-content-through-social-media-influencers-600x400.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2.\u00a0\u00a0 Achieving unique and high-quality content through social media influencers<\/h3>\n<p>Social media influencers are first and foremost content creators and they put a lot of time and effort into their content, taking pride in everything that they post online. The truth is that creating high-quality content can be hard, but it\u2019s something that Google\u2019s algorithms will pick up on. Google gives priority to websites with well-written articles, great syntax, engaging content that people actually want to read because at the end of the day, that\u2019s what they are targeting: for people to spend more time on websites instead of having high bounce rates because the longer someone stays on a website, the more likely it is that the website is interesting and relevant to the user. Google hopes to create search results that engage with their users and also keeps them coming back for more because they offer them reliable sources.<\/p>\n<p>With this in mind, collaborating with influencers will mean that clients <u><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/7-important-social-media-trends-you-need-to-know-in-2021\/\">will be getting high-quality content<\/a><\/u> regarding their services or products, which are often highly shareable. Looking at the above point, this means that the client\u2019s website has a higher chance of being shared around. Furthermore, having such content reflecting the company is always good. Having poorly written content regarding some client or another will only reflect badly on the client themselves because of association. But at the end of the day, great content, whether it goes viral or not, will create buzz and attract a wider audience to click through to the website that the social media influencer is posting about.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9855\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Put-everything-together-and-you-have-increased-engagement.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"416\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Put-everything-together-and-you-have-increased-engagement.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Put-everything-together-and-you-have-increased-engagement-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Put-everything-together-and-you-have-increased-engagement-600x400.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3.\u00a0\u00a0 Put everything together and you have increased engagement<\/h3>\n<p>When you look at the whole thing from a results-oriented angle, you\u2019ll see that what clients want and need is <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.com\/blog\/influencer-marketing\/\">engagement<\/a><\/u>. That\u2019s the whole point of SEO and making sure that their brand is visible. Having a diverse presence on the internet thanks to <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.insiderintelligence.com\/insights\/influencer-marketing-report\/\">social media marketing<\/a><\/u>, and having high-quality content, will help drive engagement in the ways that truly matter. Social media influencers will always be able to make content much more relatable to their audience, which in turn, makes the client\u2019s brand more welcoming and approachable, especially so when the social media influencer projects that image. Brand ambassadors are important in helping audiences connect with the brands that they represent, and they will inadvertently add credibility to whatever brand or services they are vouching for.<\/p>\n<h3>The future of SEO is in social media sharing<\/h3>\n<p>Social media marketing is something that is over-utilized for sales, but under-utilized for long-term and sustainable results such as content creating, driving engagement, and strengthening SEO. However, that is where the future of SEO is in, and it won\u2019t be surprising if Google Algorithms shift their focus over to social media platforms instead of what\u2019s on digital publications in the future.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, this evolutionary next step has already begun with the implementation of affiliate programs that are available to various content creators on platforms such as Youtube and TikTok. However, the optimization of this method has yet to be fully realized. There is so much more that can be done in order to bring SEO implementation to the next level on social media platforms. The next time you\u2019re wondering how to boost your company through an SEO agency or with traditional SEO methods, you might want to look into collaborating with content creators instead in order to create organic and relatable content that is naturally geared towards your demographic. People in the 21<sup>st<\/sup> century are all about authenticity and sooner, rather than later, we\u2019re likely to see traditional celebrity endorsements slowly fade into the background as we pay more attention to beauty experts and industry leaders to tell us what\u2019s what.<\/p>\n<p>Along with everything in the technological world, we have to get on with the times or risk being left behind.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Author<\/h3>\n<p>Chase Morgan is an SEO and content creating enthusiast and spends his time learning about the ins and outs of SEO implementation.
