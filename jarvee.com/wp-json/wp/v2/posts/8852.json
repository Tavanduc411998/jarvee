However, the fact that it still around does not mean that the strategies haven\u2019t changed.<\/p>\n<p>Read on to learn what effective strategies are there for this year.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8856\" style=\"width: 612px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8856\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8856 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Email-Marketing.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Email-Marketing.png 602w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Email-Marketing-300x199.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Email-Marketing-600x399.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-8856\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freepik.com\/premium-photo\/mail-communication-connection-message-mailing-contacts-phone-global-letters-concept_4998505.htm#page=1&amp;query=email%20marketing&amp;position=35\">Freepik<\/a><\/p><\/div>\n<h2>4 Strategies to Make the Most of Your Email Marketing Efforts in 2021<\/h2>\n<p>Looking for <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/important-metrics-for-email-marketing-what-you-must-know-for-maximum-success-of-your-campaign\/\">effective ways to use email for marketing purposes<\/a>? Here, we compiled the top four strategies that bring the best results in 2021.<\/p>\n<h3>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Shift Towards Mobile<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s no doubt we are living in the era of mobile devices. Today, people prefer performing most tasks using convenient, small devices.<\/p>\n<p>According to stats, the number of marketing messages opened on a mobile device is growing rapidly. In 2011, this number was 27%. In 2016, it jumped up to 55%. But, today, <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.campaignmonitor.com\/resources\/guides\/email-marketing-trends\/\">this number has crossed the point of 81%<\/a><\/u>, which is impressive!<\/p>\n<p>But what does it mean in terms of email marketing? In a nutshell, these numbers suggest that if you don\u2019t keep mobile-friendliness in mind, you are not getting the most of your campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Messages that are optimized for mobile are proven to be more effective and generate 4x higher revenues. So, the first marketing strategy you need to stick to in 2021 is mobile optimization.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few actionable tips that will help you make this shift.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Switch to responsive email design (RED) that ensures smooth optimization of the user experience (UX) to all screens and devices.<\/li>\n<li>Make your pre-header and subject line shorter so that users of mobile devices could see them fully.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure your CTAs are big and easy to notice.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.clicksend.com\/us\/sms\/email-to-sms\/\">Use email to SMS solution<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Deliver Personalized Messages<\/h3>\n<p>The next strategy you should employ in your campaigns is personalization. Today, when an average user receives hundreds of messages every single day, getting your emails noticed (and, hopefully, opened) requires more effort than ever. That\u2019s where personalization is the key to success!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8854\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Deliver-Personlaized-Messages.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Deliver-Personlaized-Messages.png 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Deliver-Personlaized-Messages-300x203.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Deliver-Personlaized-Messages-600x405.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Using customer data to personalize the messages you deliver is a sure way to boost overall customer experience, which eventually will lead to greater loyalty and retention. Besides, personalization has been proven to boost open rates. It can bring you <u><a href=\"https:\/\/marketingland.com\/study-70-brands-personalizing-emails-missing-higher-transaction-rates-revenue-73241\">6x higher transaction rates<\/a><\/u>, which is even more important.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s one more thing you need to know. Despite the undeniable benefits of personalization, many brands still don\u2019t use this strategy. That is, when you begin personalizing your messages, it will ultimately put you ahead of the competition.<\/p>\n<p>How to get started with personalization? First of all, there are two things you should do:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>start using a recipient\u2019s name in the subject line (as well as in the main text of the message);<\/li>\n<li>start collecting customer data (for example, via a sign-up form) to get the information you need for better personalization.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Benefit from Email Segmentation<\/h3>\n<p>Segmentation is one of the main trends of the past years that remains with us in 2021. So, this is one more strategy to keep in mind to maximize your outcomes.<\/p>\n<p>In a nutshell, <u><a href=\"https:\/\/smallbusiness.chron.com\/examples-database-segmentation-11961.html\">segmenting your database<\/a><\/u> implies dividing your contacts list into smaller groups of customers or prospects who share certain traits and features. This trick enables you to create more personalized messages for every group based on its characteristics and deliver much more targeted messages. Eventually, segmentation will help you boost your brand\u2019s reputation and improve all KPIs.<\/p>\n<p>If you are wondering how to get started, consider segmenting your list by any of the following characteristics:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>company size;<\/li>\n<li>industry;<\/li>\n<li>sales cycle.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doing so will give you a good starting point, and later, you will be able to tweak your segmentation strategy further to get even better results.<\/p>\n<h3>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Leverage Automation to Maximize Efficiency<\/h3>\n<p>Since <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/johnhall\/2020\/03\/15\/5-email-marketing-trends-that-can-make-you-more-efficient\/?sh=6c0b0eff1475\">marketing automation has been trending<\/a><\/u> for quite a while, we expect it to stay popular for years.<\/p>\n<p>Today, 75% of marketers are already using automation to their benefit. There are multiple ways to integrate automation into your tactic. It can be used to streamline your campaigns, collect feedback, set up funnels, create trigger emails, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>Automation has numerous perks. It not only saves lots of time for your team, but it can also improve the open and click-through rates and boost conversion. The great part of it is that automation is now available to everyone. There are plenty of smart tools that will help you get on the right track and achieve the set goals. All you need is to test these tools and find what works best for you!<\/p>\n<h2>The Bottom Line<\/h2>\n<p>To get the best results from your campaigns in 2021, you need to update your approach to email marketing to ensure it goes in line with the time.
