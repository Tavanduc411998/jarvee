But attaining social media success is easier said than done. You have to plan and execute strategies to keep your audience engaged every single moment. <\/p>\n<p>With that said, there are brands that have discovered the winning strategy for their values, personality, and voice. They know what their followers want, and deliver it over and over again. These influential brands shine on Facebook and Twitter and can teach you a thing or two about standing out on social media. Learn social media marketing from the best of the best. <\/p>\n<h3>5 Influential Brands on Facebook <\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Coca-Cola-facebook.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1025\" height=\"310\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3079\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Coca-Cola-facebook.png 1025w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Coca-Cola-facebook-300x91.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Coca-Cola-facebook-768x232.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Coca-Cola-facebook-1024x310.png 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/Coca-Cola-facebook-600x181.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1025px) 100vw, 1025px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Coca-Cola (Over 107M fans)<\/h3>\n<p>Coca-Cola is unique in that unlike most brands that have pages on Facebook, it does not keep all of its products under one page. Instead, it has individual pages for most of its products; there is one for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Fanta\">Fanta<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/DietCoke\">Diet Coke<\/a>, and even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Dasani\/\">Dasani<\/a>. It splits up individual brands to get more fans.<br \/>\nThe lesson taught by this very popular company is that it\u2019s important to have different pages for each product so that clients and prospects get to appreciate them individually.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/redbull-facebook.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1028\" height=\"307\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3082\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/redbull-facebook.png 1028w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/redbull-facebook-300x90.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/redbull-facebook-768x229.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/redbull-facebook-1024x306.png 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/redbull-facebook-600x179.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1028px) 100vw, 1028px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>RedBull (Over 47M fans)<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/redbull\">RedBull<\/a> is one of the best companies on Facebook in terms of branding. Its unique feature is that it hardly ever highlights its products. You will not find RedBull merchandise strewn all over its timeline. Instead, the company associates itself with extreme sports that seem to go with its famous tagline, \u201cRedBull gives you wings.\u201d<br \/>\nWhen marketing your brand or business on Facebook, follow Redbull\u2019s example. Don\u2019t be aggressive, be smart. Avoid promoting your products and services all the time and simply share content your audience loves.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/disney-facebook.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1023\" height=\"305\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3083\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/disney-facebook.png 1023w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/disney-facebook-300x89.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/disney-facebook-768x229.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/disney-facebook-600x179.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 1023px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Disney (51M fans)<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Disney\">Disney<\/a> is one of the brands that reign on Facebook. It stands out due to the fact that it uses popular images to communicate and interact with its followers. The company showcases the same characters that feature in its films and TV programs: Mickey Mouse, Snow White, Rapunzel, Winnie the Pooh, and many others. <\/p>\n<p>To increase engagement on Facebook, display products and services your followers are familiar with. They will develop a sense of belonging to your organization. <\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/mtv-facebook.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"310\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3084\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/mtv-facebook.png 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/mtv-facebook-300x91.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/mtv-facebook-768x233.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/mtv-facebook-600x182.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>MTV (48M fans)<\/h3>\n<p>In October 2015, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/MTV\">MTV<\/a> took part in sensitizing people on the United States National Coming Out Day. This was outstanding because, in most cases, brands keep off sensitive matters. However, the way in which MTV handled the matter saw many of its fans lauding it. In addition, MTV continues to carve out a niche for itself as a pop culture icon. <\/p>\n<p>The brand concentrates on its fans and satisfies their needs. If you want your brand to be as popular as MTV, know what your followers want and deliver it.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/startbucks-facebook.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1021\" height=\"307\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3085\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/startbucks-facebook.png 1021w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/startbucks-facebook-300x90.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/startbucks-facebook-768x231.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/startbucks-facebook-600x180.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1021px) 100vw, 1021px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Starbucks (37 million fans)<\/h3>\n<p>Oh, the smell of freshly brewing coffee! What\u2019s not to love about it? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Starbucks\">Starbucks<\/a> epitomizes coffee, and people love coffee! No wonder the brand has more than 36 million fans on Facebook. Its popularity lies in its preference for combining text with images. It also holds wonderful promotions for fans and offers free recipes. <\/p>\n<p>If you learn nothing else from Starbucks, learn that fans love freebies.<\/p>\n<h3>5 Influential Brands on Twitter <\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/tim-ferris-twitter.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"545\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3086\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/tim-ferris-twitter.png 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/tim-ferris-twitter-300x204.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/tim-ferris-twitter-768x523.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/tim-ferris-twitter-600x409.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>@tferriss (1.53M followers)<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/tferriss\">Tim Ferris<\/a> is the author of several bestseller books for entrepreneurs, but you probably know him from his famous podcast &#8211; The Tim Ferris Show, the first business-interview podcast to pass 200 million downloads.

For example, it tweeted a happy birthday message to Leonard Nimoy of Star Trek. It also reached out to Justin Beiber, who has at least 36 million followers on the platform. It explained that engaging an influencer like Beiber was critical because by forming a link with his young followers, it could influence them to study STEM careers. <\/p>\n<p>This is one of the biggest lessons that social media marketers should learn. Instead of trying to succeed alone, reach out to related influencers to form beneficial partnerships.<\/p>\n<p>These influential brands have attained success on two of the largest social media platforms in existence, but they didn\u2019t do it by chance.
