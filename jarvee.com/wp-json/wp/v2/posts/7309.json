An estimated 87% of recruiters are already using LinkedIn in order to source new talent. For comparison, 55% use Facebook and 47% use Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>LinkedIn allows recruiters to hone search criteria to find candidates with specific skills and connections, as well as offering the option to form groups. This is a great way of connecting employers and candidates with similar search criteria.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Employee engagement<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Encourage your current employees to post coordinated content on social media, highlighting the benefits of working with your company, and placing emphasis on team-building. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialpilot.co\/blog\/how-to-use-hashtags-effectively-in-social-media-marketing\">Hashtags<\/a> are a great way to create a sense of cohesion amid this kind of posts and will increase overall traffic to your content<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Consistent content <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Consistency is highly important when creating an online campaign. Coordinating posts, using a consistent platform, and making sure your content is cohesive in its style and targeting will greatly aid in giving momentum to any online campaign.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Brand representation<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Creating a recognizable and attractive culture surrounding your business is highly valuable when seeking to engage potential talent. This is especially true of brand-conscious millennials and \u201cgen Zers\u201d, who not only seek out employment opportunities, but also the chance to be part of a company\u2019s culture. Creating recognizable branding and promoting your business\u2019s ethos is a great way of encouraging candidates to identify with your company beyond a source of income.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Directing traffic<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Pool all relevant recruitment information into one, easily-found web location. Whether it be a company website, a Facebook page, Instagram profile, or a recruitment pool form, make sure potential candidates are all being directed to the same place.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Demographic targeting<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Creating an online recruitment campaign requires knowing exactly who your <a href=\"https:\/\/wearesocial.com\/blog\/2018\/03\/three-differences-gen-z-millennials-use-social-media\">target audience<\/a> is and how to target content specifically to them. Each demographic has a platform they are <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/target-market\/\">more and less suited to<\/a>, with younger people being most reachable via Instagram, and LinkedIn being preferred by those more established in the workforce.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dedication to the campaign<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For ongoing social media recruitment, it helps to dedicate time and resources to monitoring <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/10-social-media-engagement-hacks-to-boost-your-business\/\">online trends<\/a> that could be of use to a campaign. If used right, new hashtags, promotional trends, and up-and-coming social media platforms can prove invaluable tools for getting ahead of the crowd and snapping up the best potential candidates!<\/p>\n<h2>Final tips for squeezing the most out of social media<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Analytics: <\/em>Most social media platforms offer business profiles the opportunity to access their engagement analytic data. This means you can monitor information such as the age, location, and source of those trafficked to your content. This is an invaluable resource you should use to tailor future content.<\/li>\n<li><em>Collaborate: <\/em>Collaborating with other businesses and online presences is a great way to get boosted by social media algorithms and have your content displayed to a much wider audience.<\/li>\n<li><em>Video: <\/em>Creating video content is one of the most <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/hub\/content\/video\">proven strategies<\/a> for maximizing online engagement, as it\u2019s eye-catching, easily sharable, and information can be processed much faster than by reading. Live-streams and Q+As are just two options available to recruiters when it comes to creating video content.<\/li>\n<li><em>Niche networks: <\/em>Don\u2019t forget to think outside the box! Mainstream social media platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn are, of course, great for general recruitment. But if you have a position open that requires a specialized profile, don\u2019t be afraid to venture into those online niche networks where you are more likely to make direct contact with your ideal candidate.<\/li>\n<li><em>Platform tools: <\/em>Check out the tools offered by your platforms of choice. Tools such as location-tagging and <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-to-easily-schedule-your-tweets-using-twitter-and-jarvee\/\">post scheduling<\/a> to coincide with traffic surging can really help when it comes to creating a strong and consistent campaign!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Final-tips-for-squeezing-the-most-out-of-social-media.jpg\" alt=\"Final tips for squeezing the most out of social media\" width=\"336\" height=\"224\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7313\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Final-tips-for-squeezing-the-most-out-of-social-media.jpg 336w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Final-tips-for-squeezing-the-most-out-of-social-media-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>About the author<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Alina Burakova is a career guidance expert.
