Content saturation is a real phenomenon. It\u2019s harder than ever to stand out to the average internet user. Folks are inundated with a constant barrage of videos, ads, images, and other materials.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also easier than ever for users to ignore the content you send them. They can use ad blockers. They can scroll past. They can simply not pay attention.<\/p>\n<p>All of this means that copywriters must go the extra mile in order to win over potential audience members. There\u2019s no place where this is truer than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/\">Facebook<\/a>. There are still great opportunities to engage with audience members via ads and bots. The following copywriting tips can help you cut through the noise, and get the engagement you need.<\/p>\n<h3>Be Visual<\/h3>\n<p>Instead of simply using images and videos in your ad content, make them the centerpiece. Just remember that there are some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartinsights.com\/social-media-marketing\/facebook-marketing\/4-things-facebook-ad-visuals-must\/\">tips for using visuals in Facebook ads<\/a>. This includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using clear product images<\/li>\n<li>Accompanying visuals with text that is attractive and easy to read<\/li>\n<li>Using backgrounds that make visual content pop<\/li>\n<li>Adding graphics and icons to draw the viewer\u2019s eyes to important parts of your add such as your CTA<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Focus on Problems And Solutions<\/h3>\n<p>Remember that your audience isn\u2019t necessarily going to be focused on making a purchase. Instead, they often have a problem that needs a solution. Know the problems that your products and services can solve. Then, focus on those problems and solutions in your ad copy.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you sell financial planning services, make a list of the problems that somebody might come to you to solve. This might include:<\/p>\n<p>Problem &#8211; I don\u2019t understand how saving for retirement impacts the income taxes that I have to pay?<\/p>\n<p>Solution &#8211; Our investment advisors will explain the ways in which retirement savings can affect the amount of taxes you pay today and in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve identified a primary list of problems and solutions, you can begin creating ad content that details how your products and services can help.<\/p>\n<h3>Be Precise in Your Targeting<\/h3>\n<p>Your advertising copy should make it very clear to your audience that you are addressing them. Create a very detailed target personas. Identify them clearly in your copy. Remember that targeting \u2018everybody\u2019 is the same as targeting \u2018nobody\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine that you have an online travel agency. Your customers might range from budget travelers to luxury travelers. They may be seeking international travel opportunities, domestic travel, cruises, adventure travel, etc. In order to get the most engagement, each ad should specifically target viewers according to those interests. The same is true for your chatbot dialogue.<\/p>\n<p>For example, \u2018Are you interested in luxury hotels in the Caribbean this summer?\u2019 is going to drive conversation and conversions more than, \u2018We can help with your travel arrangements.\u2019<\/p>\n<h3>Conversations Not Lectures<\/h3>\n<p>Chatbot users should feel as if they are having a conversation with a friend, not as if they are attending a speech. Avoid jargon and overly complex terms. Use short sentences. Write a conversational dialogue. Use a tone that\u2019s casual, but professional.<\/p>\n<p>Keep your audience in mind. Take care when using slang. You don\u2019t want your readers to find it off-putting or unprofessional. Be aware that using slang can also make it seem as if you are trying too hard. The same goes for using emojis. In the right circumstance, emojis are friendly and welcoming. On the other hand, they aren\u2019t the best choice for every brand or every conversation.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, remember that people are engaging with your chatbots to accomplish a task. Every piece of conversation should be purposeful. It should drive the user towards a solution to their problem. It takes work to learn how to <a href=\"https:\/\/chatbotsmagazine.com\/how-to-write-winning-dialogue-for-conversational-ui-26744031dd65\">write dialogue for conversational UI<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Create a Personality For Better Connections<\/h3>\n<p>People often use chatbots as a means to end-run human interaction. In spite of this, human-style interaction is exactly what they crave when they do that. They aren\u2019t seeking personality-free, robotic interactions. They want to engage with bots that have character.<\/p>\n<p>The same can be said for ad copy. Audiences don\u2019t just respond to the information and offer in an ad. They respond to the tone. Ads are also another forum for you to project your branding. That means writing copy in a way that reflects your brand persona.<\/p>\n<h3>Keep it Simple And Straightforward<\/h3>\n<p>There are a time and place for in-depth content that really digs into important topics. This isn\u2019t the place for that. Instead, you want your audience to quickly get your message, then answer your call to action. Keep ad content short, simple, and to the point. Make your call to action text clear and impactful. Your target audience should know what you want them to do, and why it benefits them to do that thing.<\/p>\n<h3>Don\u2019t be Too Aggressive<\/h3>\n<p>This tip applies to chatbots in particular. It can be difficult to find a balance between using messenger bots to nudge customers further down the sales funnel. Certainly, you want to recommend products and services when that\u2019s appropriate. On the other hand, your focus should be on keeping things light, providing help and information, and ensuring that interactions are enjoyable.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to going easy on the sales pressure, take it slow when introducing your customer to new concepts. Introduce one idea at a time. Ask for confirmation that they understand. Don\u2019t move on until the user indicates that they are comfortable and ready. Finally, give the customer an out. For example, if they want to bypass product recommendations or other content, and only have their questions answered, let them do that. You should also provide them with a clear pathway to access help from a live agent.<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>Use the advice above to create <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/ads\">Facebook advertising<\/a> and chatbot copy to reach your audience with content that connects with them. Then, make sure to track your results using analytics. The resulting data will give you insights for improving your efforts further.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the author<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Daniela McVicker is a passionate digital marketer.
