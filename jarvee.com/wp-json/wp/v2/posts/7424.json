Even though social media is a gold mine, you won\u2019t strike gold if you don\u2019t know where to look.<\/p>\n<p>Having specific goals not only saves you time and effort during execution, but it also ensures that you achieve results in record time. This way, you can identify the <a href=\"https:\/\/us.accion.org\/resource\/choosing-right-social-media-platform-your-business\/\">social platforms that suit your business needs<\/a> and the content to create for each platform.<\/p>\n<p>Here is what you should focus on as you define your goals;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choosing social platforms that make it easy for customers to reach you. This way, you can improve your customer service offerings because you\u2019ll be able to respond to concerns, questions, and complaints promptly. This also allows you to identify new leads much quicker, so you can target them with timely and relevant content.<\/li>\n<li>Targeting prospects who are receptive to your content and penetrating new demographics with the right content.<\/li>\n<li>Increasing brand exposure and brand awareness to make your business more accessible by new people.<\/li>\n<li>Learning about the shopping habits of your customers and using this information to boost your sales.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Determine what Channels your Audience is already using<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve set your goals, the next step is to find out where the majority of your customers spend most of their time. You need to target customers on a platform they\u2019re already using.<\/p>\n<p>Choosing a platform where your audience doesn\u2019t operate beats the whole purpose of using it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/331004\">as a marketing tool<\/a>. Take time to do an in-depth analysis to identify the platforms that your customers prefer. Seek your customers out on the networks they\u2019re already active on.<\/p>\n<p>The most straightforward way to find out where most of your customers are is by conducting a customer survey. You need a questionnaire that asks all the right questions for this;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which social media sites do they frequent<\/li>\n<li>Where do they go when they want clarification about something<\/li>\n<li>Which influencers do they follow<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Another way of getting this information is by paying attention to the traffic on different social media sites. A platform like Facebook will actually estimate your audience size and help you target your ideal customers. All you have to do is tell them who your ideal customer is.<\/p>\n<h2>Examine the Type of Content you typically create<\/h2>\n<p>Each social media platform is unique, so you can\u2019t approach them with a one-fits-all paradigm.

The platform gets over 2.4 billion active users every month. Even though you won\u2019t be targeting all Facebook users, the more the overall number of users, the more prospects you\u2019re likely to target.<\/p>\n<p>This is an excellent platform for advertising and lead generation because you can easily customize your content to target specific audiences.<\/p>\n<p>The platform also helps you humanize your brand and create lasting relationships between customers and your business. Leads will easily turn into loyal followers if you let them in on the human side of your business.<\/p>\n<h3>Twitter<\/h3>\n<p>If your business is about immediacy, Twitter is your go-to platform because you can easily reach your audience with announcements, important messages, breaking news, and other in-the-moment information.<\/p>\n<p>The majority of Twitter users are below 50 years, and the content that works best here is information that\u2019s easy to digest.<\/p>\n<h3>LinkedIn<\/h3>\n<p>As a B2B business owner, this should be your social media platform of choice. The main goal of LinkedIn is lead generation, and the content that works best here is editorials that position you as a leader in your industry. LinkedIn helps business owners build trust, present themselves as an authoritative brand, as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/socialmediaweek.org\/blog\/2020\/05\/how-linkedin-is-fueling-virtual-engagement\/\">facilitate engagement<\/a> through conversations.<\/p>\n<h3>Pinterest<\/h3>\n<p>For this platform, your focus should be on publishing high-quality images. If you want to drive up your sales, this is the platform for you because images help customers plan for purchases. As you create content, bear in mind that more women use Pinterest as compared to men.<\/p>\n<h3>Instagram<\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s a good choice if you prefer to count on the good relationships with you and the customer. You can show your product, stories about company life or manufacture, engage customers to talk with you with questionnaires and giveaways. Also, it&#8217;s the perfect platform for partnerships with influencers.<\/p>\n<h3>TikTok<\/h3>\n<p>This platform presents everything youth live today. Videos and music are the souls of this social network. Being a business itself, TikTok encourages businesses no matter how big or small they are to create accounts and show the people behind the brand. Maybe it&#8217;s not the best place to sell something, but it can be good for your reputation and popularity.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Social media is a valuable marketing tool for businesses today.
