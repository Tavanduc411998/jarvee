To do this, it is enough to integrate the mobile device into the system and open\/close the gate, you need to press just a couple of buttons on the smartphone.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, it has laser and voice commands, as well as smart notifications for monitoring. This will allow you to create your commands in <a href=\"https:\/\/assistant.google.com\">Google Assistant<\/a>, and, for example, set the time for automatic opening\/closing of the gate.<\/p>\n<h2>\u21167. Soil moisture detection<\/h2>\n<p>To automate the soil irrigation system, a project was created using Python. For example, using moisture sensors that determine its level, you can set the options for automatic irrigation.<\/p>\n<h2>\u21168. Smart alarm clock<\/h2>\n<p>The smart alarm system is not a simple device that wakes up in the morning, several functions and tasks are implemented in it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>text-to-speech translator;<\/li>\n<li>volume control of the audio amplifier;<\/li>\n<li>automatic setting of display brightness;<\/li>\n<li>voice commands to enable video chat and perform standard commands;<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0 screen displaying text.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can wake up the device in one of three ways, playing mp3 files, music from radio stations, or news stream podcasts.<\/p>\n<h2>\u21169. Smart farming system<\/h2>\n<p>With the help of the smart agriculture system, many basic tasks can be simplified, human resources and time can be saved. For example, set up an automatic system for fertilizing plants or treating them with pesticides using a smartphone.<\/p>\n<h2>\u211610. Smart energy grid<\/h2>\n<p>The power grid in many countries is not optimized, which leads to constant interruptions and massive blackouts. The smart energy grid is one of the best and most essential projects in the IoT world.<\/p>\n<p>The ATmega family controller can be used to monitor and control the system. All you need to do is connect to Wi-Fi and go to the IoTGecko web page. The goal of the project is to facilitate reconnection after the interruption of network contacts. That is, after shutdown, the system switches to another line and ensures uninterrupted operation. A registered user can log into IoTGecko and see which grids are active and which are not. You can also monitor the amount of electricity consumed and possible leaks.<\/p>\n<h2>\u211611. Use voice search to promote<\/h2>\n<p>The number of queries that users make by voice is growing. It is necessary to optimize the content for this parameter. It is necessary to conduct a thorough analysis of which voice queries are being used. Try creating request-response pairs. Simple dialogue questions need to be supplemented with full-fledged answers, which are introduced into the main content of the site.<\/p>\n<h2>\u211612. SERP helps in the development<\/h2>\n<p>The use of internet-controlled devices reduces the need to visit sites. The devices will themselves find information on the necessary sites and, ready-made will provide it to users through their interface. Therefore, it is important to optimize sites not for visits, but for Google Featured Snippets.<\/p>\n<h2>\u211613. Search Trends Driven by the Internet of Things<\/h2>\n<p>It is extremely important to understand that the behavior and search algorithm for users and devices with an Internet connection is significantly different.
