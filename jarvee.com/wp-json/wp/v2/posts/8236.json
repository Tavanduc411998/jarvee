Baby boomers, millennials, Generation Z, you name it &#8211; they\u2019re all on social networks. If you\u2019re running a business, it would be a mistake to not leverage social media\u2019s reach for your marketing campaigns.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">But for you to maximize the benefits of your social media campaign, you need to know how to run it the right way. That means coming up with a\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-create-social-media-marketing-plan-from-scratch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">social media marketing plan<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0first. And for that plan to be effective, it should involve using this critical element: the social media landing page.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">What is a Social Media Landing Page?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">But let\u2019s back up a bit. What exactly is a social media landing page?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Simply put, a landing page is where people who click on your link \u201cland\u201d. It is a stand-alone page on your website created to get people to take your desired action. That desired action might include signing up for your mailing list, registering for an event, or making a purchase.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A social media landing page, then, is where people \u201cland\u201d when they click your link in a social media post. Marketers use social media landing pages in both paid and organic marketing campaigns. So people clicking on your company&#8217;s social media post about the latest sale or an upcoming webinar will land on the right page for that campaign.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Why Should You Use One?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Social media landing pages are critical to the success of your campaign for many reasons. Here are the things a social media landing page can do for you and your business:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Improves Brand Awareness<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Consistency is vital to any\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/effective-steps-of-a-social-media-marketing-campaign\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">social media campaign<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">. That\u2019s because you want people to know they\u2019re interacting with the same brand when they move from a social media post to the landing page. If they get confused or encounter conflicting messages, they will leave without taking the desired action.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In other words, the social media landing page should mirror the original content. A social media landing page mirrors the original content if it contains aligned messaging and matching design elements such as the brand logo, brand name, color palette, and imagery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Here\u2019s an example of a <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Facebook ad:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8240\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/facebook-marketing-post.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"383\" height=\"393\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/facebook-marketing-post.png 383w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/facebook-marketing-post-292x300.png 292w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">And this image below is the social media landing page you\u2019re directed to when you click on the ad:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8239\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/facebook-landing-page.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"541\" height=\"272\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/facebook-landing-page.png 541w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/facebook-landing-page-300x151.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Since the critical brand elements are there on the landing page, we can say the social landing page improves brand awareness. According to\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/b\/brandawareness.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Investopedia<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, brand awareness is the degree of consumer recognition of a product or company by its name. It is vital to your business\u2019 success.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Boosts Online Shopping<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Social media landing pages boost online sales because they make it quick and easy for people to buy from you. A social media landing page gives a clear call to action and a simple way to follow it. Check out this example from the Twitter account of <\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WarbyParker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Warby Parker:<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8243\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/twitter-marketing-post.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/twitter-marketing-post.png 500w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/twitter-marketing-post-300x216.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When you click on the above post that aims to promote the company\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.warbyparker.com\/\">Butler glasses<\/a>, you get to this social media landing page:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8242\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/twitter-landing-page.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/twitter-landing-page.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/twitter-landing-page-300x126.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/twitter-landing-page-600x253.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Notice that you can only do one of two things on the page. \u201cSelect lenses and purchase\u201d or \u201ctry at home for free\u201d. If you want to make a purchase, you choose the first option. If you\u2019re still not convinced, you select the second option, but that will likely lead to you still buying the glasses because you can see how good you look wearing them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In other words, Warby Parker\u2019s social media landing page has one aim: to get you to make a purchase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Targeted pages fare well when it comes to conversions.\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/truelist.co\/blog\/landing-page-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Truelist<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0said these pages could increase conversions to up to 300%! Imagine if people were sent to a homepage instead. They\u2019d have to search the entire\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.shift4shop.com\/ecommerce-website-guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">e-commerce website<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0for the product they\u2019d just seen on social media. Customers are busy people. If you make things too difficult, they will likely give up and leave your site without taking action.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Creates Targeted Coupons and Offers<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">You can also use your social media landing page to give targeted coupons and offers aimed at achieving a specific goal, such as selling more of a particular product or growing your email list.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The page should give specific instructions on how customers can take advantage of the offer. Amazon, for example, devoted an entire social media landing page to its\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/b?node=5856181011\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Subscribe and Save offer<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8238\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/amazon-coupon.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/amazon-coupon.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/amazon-coupon-300x108.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/amazon-coupon-600x216.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Buyers can save up to 15% off Amazon products and receive free shipping. All the calls to action on the page are related to this particular offer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This relates to the ease and simplicity we discussed above. If you show people exactly how to take advantage of your coupons and offers, you\u2019ll increase your chances of getting them to take your desired action.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Promotes Your Events or Webinars<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Your social media landing page can also help you promote your events, such as conferences and webinars. According to\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sageworld.com\/blog\/index.php\/2020\/07\/09\/5-reasons-why-you-should-host-webinars\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Sage World<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, you should host webinars and events for several reasons:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u25cf They develop authority and trust.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u25cf They create brand awareness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u25cf They help you understand your target audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u25cf They generate leads.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u25cf They are convenient and affordable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In other words,\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/5-creative-ways-brands-can-use-webinar-in-social-media\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">hosting webinars<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0and events helps your business grow and thrive.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Your social media page must contain all the details prospects need to know about the event. You can also include a registration form so they can sign up immediately. That is precisely what\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.dalestephenmediamarketing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Dale Stephen Media Marketing<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, a company that sells digital marketing services, does:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8244\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/webinar.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"343\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/webinar.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/webinar-300x165.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/webinar-600x330.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">With social media landing pages, you can plan your events and webinars properly and maximize sign-ups. You can generate leads you can nurture and turn into paying customers, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Drives More Product Trials and Demos<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">If you\u2019re selling software, you will have to get people to try out your product or give them a demo. According to\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/demodesk.com\/blog\/product-demo\/what-is-product-demo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Demodesk<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">, the demo is the most crucial part of the software sales process. That\u2019s because it often means the difference between closing a deal and losing a prospect. Social media is a great way to drum up interest in your product and encourage people to sign up for a demo.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">But instead of directing prospects to your homepage, bring them to a social media landing page. With a targeted social media landing page, you can allow prospects to\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/virtualcreativestudios.com\/request-a-demo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">register for a demo in seconds<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8241\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/product-demo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"252\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/product-demo.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/product-demo-300x121.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/product-demo-600x242.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Be careful not to include too many fields on the form, though. Keep it short and simple. Remember, you have to make everything as easy as possible for your potential buyers. That\u2019s the only way you can get them to convert.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">In closing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Businesses cannot afford to ignore social media\u2019s reach. Social media campaigns should, therefore, already be part and parcel of any good marketing strategy. And at the heart of a great social media campaign is the social media landing page.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Social media landing pages can help your business in many ways. They work because they give specific instructions on how to take your desired action. You can use them to boost sales from online shopping, provide offers and coupons, and drive sign-ups for your webinars or events. You can also grow your mailing list and invite prospects to register for a product demo. On top of all of that, social media landing pages improve brand awareness, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The bottom line is that social media landing pages are critical to getting the most out of your social media marketing efforts.
