Fundraising in 2021 still looks different than it has in years past. Hosting big events to draw in donations isn\u2019t likely to happen anytime soon. Therefore, figuring out how to reach donors in new ways is a vital part of keeping operations running.<\/p>\n<p>The Association of Fundraising Professionals surveyed nonprofits about the impact of COVID-19 and found <a href=\"https:\/\/afpglobal.org\/sites\/default\/files\/attachments\/resource\/AFPCOVIDSurveyFindingsUSinfographic.pdf\">56% of leadership believed they&#8217;d raise less money this year<\/a>. About one-fourth felt they\u2019d reach the same amount as in 2020 and about one-fourth thought they\u2019d raise more.<\/p>\n<p>Your outlook on fundraising may depend upon your perspective. If you go into the fiscal year armed with some tools for effectively seeking donations, you&#8217;re more likely to have a positive outlook and success. Here are eight fundraising strategies to use in the middle of a pandemic.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Seek Organizations<\/h2>\n<p>Even though individual donations may make up the bulk of your fundraising efforts, don\u2019t forget about foundations. A report by Giving USA found <a href=\"https:\/\/givingusa.org\/giving-usa-2019-americans-gave-427-71-billion-to-charity-in-2018-amid-complex-year-for-charitable-giving\/\">foundation giving grew by 18% in 2018.<\/a> However, corporate giving depends upon pretax dollars and may be a little more turbulent.<\/p>\n<p>Think of corporate sponsors as the icing on the cake. Make sure you keep in touch with individual donors but also go after the bigger ones. Create a short elevator pitch and cold call if you must. Look for companies that match your cause. If you help children in need, seek sponsorship from a kids\u2019 clothing company or educational provider.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Accept Donations Online<\/h2>\n<p>People are home more than ever due to social distancing. You can make it easier for them to donate by accepting online contributions. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.givesmart.com\/blog\/5-secrets-to-virtual-fundraising-success\/\">Online giving rose by 10%<\/a> in 2019, and people gave 11% more online than in person.<\/p>\n<p>Remind your regular supporters <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/why-email-marketing-is-still-not-dead-in-2021\/\">via email<\/a> and social media. Make it as simple as possible for them to give.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8229 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/tell-a-story.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"599\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/tell-a-story.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/tell-a-story-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/tell-a-story-768x575.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/tell-a-story-600x449.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>3. Tell a Story<\/h2>\n<p>Explain the reason you\u2019re raising money. Share a story about how you helped someone and the difference it made in their life. Think about the animal shelter ads you\u2019ve seen on television that follow the story of a cat or dog that was abused or neglected. They share how the organization helped the pet and found it a new home.<\/p>\n<p>You must do something similar with any piece of content you post either online or offline through\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mycreativeshop.com\/templates\/flyers\/fundraising\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fundraising flyers<\/a>. How can you tell a story and show the value you add to your community?<\/p>\n<h2>4. Be Transparent<\/h2>\n<p>People want to know their donations go to a good cause. Be transparent about how you spend your money. In a recent survey, <a href=\"https:\/\/stackla.com\/resources\/reports\/the-consumer-content-report-influence-in-the-digital-age\/\">86% of consumers felt authenticity was vital <\/a>in deciding whether to do business with a brand. It stands to reason it\u2019s even more important from a nonprofit.<\/p>\n<p>Share where the money goes and how much is for administrative costs. People don\u2019t expect you to operate without a budget, but they do want you to be frugal and spend their money wisely. They want to know as much as possible goes to the cause.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Listen to Your Donors<\/h2>\n<p>Talk to those who support you about what the future looks like for them and your organization. Some may no longer have the funds to donate money, but they can offer their time or connections to help you raise more than in the past.<\/p>\n<p>Be open to fresh, new ideas. Those who have watched your growth over the years may have creative solutions you haven\u2019t thought of.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Mean What You Say<\/h2>\n<p>Deloitte conducted a survey of 2,447 people in eight different countries. It found people were highly attuned to the negative actions of brands during the COVID-19 crisis. About <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/content\/dam\/insights\/us\/articles\/6963_global-marketing-trends\/DI_2021-Global-Marketing-Trends_US.pdf\">66% of survey respondents<\/a> remembered when a company acted in its self-interest instead of worrying about those in its community.<\/p>\n<p>About 25% of those asked said they walked away from brands that weren&#8217;t seen as trustworthy. You want your sponsors to think highly of your not-for-profit company. However, you also must make good decisions in the future. If you make a mistake, own up to it and explain how you&#8217;ll do better. Be aware of how others perceive your actions.<\/p>\n<h2>7. Ask for Help<\/h2>\n<p>Reach out to those who\u2019ve given to you in the past and explain your needs. Ask them to share your organization\u2019s mission on social media and to tell their family and friends. Word-of-mouth marketing is a powerful tool that only costs you the time it takes to ask for help.<\/p>\n<p>Those who truly believe in your cause are happy to spread the word. Give them information about your nonprofit to share with others and watch the number of supporters gradually increase.<\/p>\n<h2>8. Advertise Online<\/h2>\n<p>Advertise on social media, in a newsletter pertaining to your nonprofit, or on Google. Think about who your target audience is and reach a specific buyer persona with your ads. The goal is to drive traffic to your site and convert people into subscribers. You can then share what you\u2019re doing and what help you need to achieve more.<\/p>\n<h2>9. Strive to Increase Awareness<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to finding ongoing support, a big part of the equation is increasing name recognition for your organization. Word-of-mouth is one of the most powerful marketing tools you have. It costs nothing but a bit of your time.<\/p>\n<p>Be sure to ask your current loyal donors to tell others about your organization and what you\u2019re doing. Host an event where they can bring a friend for free. Encourage them to bring someone who might want to help the cause.<\/p>\n<h2>10. Improve Mobile Interactions<\/h2>\n<p>More people than ever before are using their smartphones to access the internet. Think about how you can easily increase mobile engagement with your patrons. Provide an app where they can donate, start a mini fundraiser, get sponsors for a walk or run and see updates about your funding.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure your website responds to smaller screens and everything is viewable and functions correctly. Survey your mailing list about the app and find out what you can do to make improvements.<\/p>\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8231 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/be-creative.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/be-creative.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/be-creative-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/be-creative-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/be-creative-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/h2>\n<h2>Get Creative<\/h2>\n<p>Most of 2021 will likely limit in-person gatherings and the dinners and events many organizations relied on for past fundraisers. Think about how you can offer a get-together online, space people out in warm weather, or reach new donors who don\u2019t need to attend an event to support you. Consider what\u2019s worked in the past and repeat successful endeavors while trying new things that might increase giving exponentially.<\/p>\n<h2>Author<\/h2>\n<p>Eleanor Hecks is editor-in-chief at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/designerly.com\/\">Designerly Magazine<\/a>.
