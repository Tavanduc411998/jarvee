					<description><![CDATA[After reading this article I took action right away, I joined my city groups and I promoted one of my traveling packages to another city and sent them directly to my websites. I got some calls and few reservations. It&#039;s just a lot of manual work to find groups and post to them, especially if you plan to do it regularly. I will probably sign up for Jarvee and give it a try.

Thank you for the tips, I still need to learn a lot.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I took a look at Jarvee features and I saw that I also can send friends requests to group members, based on your experience do you think it&#039;s a good idea to use 3 - 4 Facebook accounts to add friends that might be interested in traveling and then promote my business by adding them to my group?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s really a bad idea to put the whole source of traffic and income in the hands of Google, I had a website getting me thousands of visitors per month for more than a year and in 2010 Google made an update to their ranking algorythm and I lost %90 of my monthly visitors.

And since then I promised myself that I will never make the same mistake again.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a travel agency owner, I would recommend considering adding a live chat feature in your website if you have the staff to monitor it and answer potential clients questions. This shows them that they will always find help when needed and that your company is always available to solve their issues and it will get you a higher conversion rate for sure.]]></description>
