The question that many business owners face is whether or not a business phone system such as a <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fcc.gov\/general\/voice-over-internet-protocol-voip#:~:text=Voice%20over%20Internet%20Protocol%20(VoIP)%2C%20is%20a%20technology%20that,(or%20analog)%20phone%20line.\">VoIP system<\/a><\/u>, is worth it. The fact is, in almost every scenario, the answer to that question is a resounding \u201cyes.\u201d You need a system that makes it easy and efficient to connect with customers, vendors, partners, and your staff members, and a VoIP phone system can do that for you.<\/p>\n<h2>Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP)<\/h2>\n<p>VoIP <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.singlegrain.com\/resources\/best-business-phone-services\/\">phone services<\/a><\/u> run through the internet, as opposed to a traditional phone service that runs through telephone lines. Audio is digitized and transmitted through the web, but completely in real-time. There\u2019s no lag, and you can still connect with traditional landline phones. In the past, VoIP calls were convenient, but they had a much lower standard of call quality. However, with the evolution and improvement of technology, VoIP calls are indistinguishable from other calls.<\/p>\n<p>One of the great things about VoIP is that it can be integrated into whatever your current system is. There\u2019s no need to upgrade or change your system at all. You just need to add VoIP functionality and you are good to go. Using VoIP, you can unlock many handy features, such as being able to make and receive calls on your business phone line using any of your phones or devices. You can be connected to your business, your customers, and your partners no matter where you are. Here are some of the other benefits of using VoIP for your small business.<\/p>\n<h3>It\u2019s Scalable<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s no doubt that most people want to grow their business. When they do, it not only brings in more revenue, but it brings in challenges as well. You may need to hire more staff, and you may need more infrastructure, equipment, and enhanced customer services. With VoIP, you can quickly and easily add phone extensions for new staff, and IVR functionality if need be. Of course, if you ramp things down you can downscale easily as well. Many VoIP service providers will even mail you new phones as you add extensions, so you won\u2019t need technicians or service calls to get everyone connected. No extra lines, no extra outlets, and no extra effort involved. The infrastructure you need is already in place, no matter where you want to take your business.<\/p>\n<h3>Improved Connection<\/h3>\n<p>In the past, setting up a new phone system in an office required a lot of work. Wires had to be run through the building and attached to outlets, and technicians needed to sometimes spend hours setting things up. It was messy and it took forever to implement. This is not the case with VoIP. You can quickly and easily access VoIP phone service through an existing internet connection. No new wiring is needed, and your current broadband connections will work perfectly for it. With <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/encyclopedia\/term\/cloud-based\">cloud-based <\/a><\/u>VoIP services, you don\u2019t even need more hardware. You can just access it with your current devices and you are up and running. Since the audio is sent as a digital data package, it\u2019s as clear as any streaming or video call you might already use.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9666\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Improved-Connection.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Improved-Connection.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Improved-Connection-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Improved-Connection-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Cost Efficiency<\/h3>\n<p>Running a small business means having to make sure that every investment you make is <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/maryjuetten\/2019\/10\/10\/best-company-traits-efficiency\/?sh=517a3f8a2317\">efficient <\/a><\/u>and effective. This holds true even for your phone system. VoIP is an affordable option that does not require maintenance and equipment that can drive up costs. It\u2019s easy to set up, easy to use and doesn\u2019t require maintenance and repairs. Adding new lines can be done with a few clicks of a keyboard, and the wiring in your building can remain unchanged. On top of all of this, VoIP phone systems tend to be more affordable than standard phone lines, since you are not paying for all of that infrastructure.<\/p>\n<h3>All The Features You Need<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to a business phone system, you need features. You require holds, transfers, call forwarding, voicemail, caller ID, and everything else that will allow you to connect with your customers and never miss an attempted contact. Calls through VoIP are digitized, which means they are quickly recorded and can be easily transferred as digital files. You can get voicemails emailed or texted to you, so you can have copies on hand at all times. These <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/guide-to-customer-relationship-management\/\">files can then be saved in your CRM<\/a> or other databases so that you always have a record. They can be forwarded to others if necessary, and nothing gets lost in the translation from audio to notepad. VoIP also allows for video conferencing, which adds a layer of connectivity and communication with your team.<\/p>\n<h3>Remote Work and On-The-Go<\/h3>\n<p>Nowadays, we are connected wherever we go, and you need your business phone to be connected, too. VoIP offers the ability for those who spend time outside of the office, or <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-to-maintain-business-continuity-during-remote-collaboration\/\">who work remotely<\/a>, to always have access to their business phone line. Since <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/12\/15\/one-in-four-americans-will-be-working-remotely-in-2021-survey.html\">more people than ever<\/a><\/u> work from home, this is incredibly valuable. In most cases, this involves a simple solution such as a mobile app that will route incoming and outgoing business calls through the VoIP service. That way, you never have to miss a call from a customer or prospect no matter where your team is working from.<\/p>\n<p>This can dramatically improve customer service since it can be frustrating to leave voicemails without knowing if someone will respond, or try several different phone numbers to try to connect. Staff who work remotely, either full-time or on a hybrid schedule, won\u2019t need to have different phone numbers depending on where they happen to be working on a certain day. Connectivity is seamless and simple with VoIP.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9667\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Remote-Work-and-On-The-Go.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Remote-Work-and-On-The-Go.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Remote-Work-and-On-The-Go-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Remote-Work-and-On-The-Go-600x399.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The original question at the beginning of this article was whether VoIP is worth it for a small business. With all of these benefits, there\u2019s no doubt that using VoIP for your small business phone system offers several benefits and advantages. All this suggests that it is more than worth it, and something you should pursue your business, no matter the size.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Author<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-9665 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Amanda-Witman.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"133\" height=\"201\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Amanda-Witman.png 207w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Amanda-Witman-200x300.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 133px) 100vw, 133px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:witmanwrites@gmail.com\">Amanda Witman<\/a> is a freelance writer and editor who is passionate about communicating ideas to <a href=\"https:\/\/mindshift.money\/personal-finance\/protect-yourself\/subscription-boxes\/\">improve readers\u2019 lives<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>She has a background in government public relations but has experience writing for many sectors including the <a href=\"https:\/\/mindshift.money\/business\/starting-your-business\/starting-a-business-round-up\/\">financial<\/a>, tech, culinary, environmental, and sports industries.
