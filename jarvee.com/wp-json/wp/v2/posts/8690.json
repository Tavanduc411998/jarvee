Every time someone reloads their timeline, there are more posts.<\/p>\n<p>Marketers need to do something to stand out from the crowd. Infographics can help businesses do just that.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/5-tools-help-create-infographics-social-media-marketing\/\">creating infographics for social media<\/a>, choose the right infographic layout, outlined below.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8692\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/infographic-layout.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"393\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/infographic-layout.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/infographic-layout-300x189.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/infographic-layout-600x378.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But, how do infographics generate leads on social media? In this guide, we explain why infographics are so effective and how to use them on different channels.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Should You Use Infographics to Generate Leads?<\/h2>\n<p>According to a survey of B2B lead generation marketers, original visuals, like infographics, successfully helped them reach marketing goals.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8699\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/visual-content-marketing-goals.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/visual-content-marketing-goals.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/visual-content-marketing-goals-300x216.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/visual-content-marketing-goals-600x432.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Infographics are also one of the top <a href=\"https:\/\/infographicsarchive.com\/five-content-marketing-trends-you-should-watch-in-2021\/\">content marketing trends in 2021<\/a>. Here are three reasons why infographics are an impactful tool in the lead gen process:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Infographics are visual<\/li>\n<li>They display thought leadership<\/li>\n<li>They break down complex data<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We will go into more detail for each of these points below.<\/p>\n<h3>1.\u00a0\u00a0 Infographics are Visual<\/h3>\n<p>Did you know that 65% of human beings are visual learners? People don\u2019t absorb all textual information\u2014they need additional visual aids to help them memorize and understand.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8700\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/visual-infographics.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"468\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/visual-infographics.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/visual-infographics-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/visual-infographics-600x450.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That is why more visual content is needed to engage and educate online audiences. Not only can infographics make content more attractive, but they make it more engaging.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, users\u2019 attention spans online have decreased significantly. They need skimmable content to stay engaged. Mini infographics are much easier to skim than text.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, lead generation is only as successful as the tools marketers use to attract audiences. Infographics are those tools.<\/p>\n<h3>2.\u00a0\u00a0 Infographics Display Thought Leadership<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/shanebarker.com\/blog\/thought-leadership-marketing\/\">Thought leadership has become an important facet of marketing<\/a>. It helps build a brand\u2019s reputation and makes marketing teams recognizable in their industries.<\/p>\n<p>Infographics, like the one below about diversity and inclusion, show how dedicated a business is to explore a subject with its audience.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8694\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/infographics-thought-leadership.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"1593\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/infographics-thought-leadership.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/infographics-thought-leadership-118x300.png 118w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/infographics-thought-leadership-401x1024.png 401w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/infographics-thought-leadership-600x1532.png 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/infographics-thought-leadership-602x1536.png 602w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Businesses can also build trust by creating simple graphics that share a wealth of knowledge. Using thought leadership, marketers can successfully take prospects through the lead funnel.<\/p>\n<h3>3.\u00a0\u00a0 Infographics Break Down Complex Data<\/h3>\n<p>Data has become one of the key drivers for marketing. Well-analyzed data can generate sales, build the user base, and create loyal customers who become advocates for the brand.<\/p>\n<p>But while <a href=\"https:\/\/digitalducats.com\/data-driven-marketing\/\">data-driven marketing<\/a> powers campaigns, how can marketers display data to audiences without confusing them?<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where infographics come in. They can break down the most complex data into bite-sized and easily digestible information, like this data infographic example.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8693\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Infographics-Break-Down-Complex-Data.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"967\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Infographics-Break-Down-Complex-Data.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Infographics-Break-Down-Complex-Data-194x300.png 194w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Infographics-Break-Down-Complex-Data-600x930.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are numerous facts included in this infographic but that doesn\u2019t make it confusing. The flow is simple, and the icons tell a story.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve shared the three reasons why infographics can be used to generate leads. How can infographics be adapted to the various social media channels?<\/p>\n<h2>6 Ways to Generate Social Media Leads Using Infographics<\/h2>\n<p>There are so many social channels, all of which are taking a visual-forward approach. If marketers want to generate social leads, they need to up their visual game.<\/p>\n<p>We share how to create infographics that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uplead.com\/buy-leads\/\">generate sales<\/a> on the biggest social media channels.<\/p>\n<h3>1.\u00a0\u00a0 Facebook<\/h3>\n<p>Facebook is a tricky channel. There have been a lot of controversies around privacy and the amplification of certain types of accounts and posts.<\/p>\n<p>Marketers using Facebook in their lead generation process need to be careful about the kind of infographics they share on this channel.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a statistical graphic like this should include the source. This helps build trust in a brand and its messaging.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8691\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Facebook-Infographics.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"327\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Facebook-Infographics.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Facebook-Infographics-300x157.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Facebook-Infographics-600x314.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Also, note the size of images for Facebook, which is 1200px by 620px. Creating an infographic of that size will ensure that users see the image in its entirety.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that Facebook isn\u2019t primarily used as a news channel. It\u2019s more a way for people to keep in touch with friends and family.<\/p>\n<p>Keep Facebook graphics to the point and easy to consume so a brand\u2019s posts don\u2019t encroach on users\u2019 connections with their families.<\/p>\n<h3>2.\u00a0\u00a0 LinkedIn<\/h3>\n<p>LinkedIn is a great channel to run a lead generation campaign using infographics. While LinkedIn business accounts don\u2019t have huge followings, they are a more engaged group.<\/p>\n<p>However, sharing infographics on LinkedIn can be a challenge. Vertical infographics get cropped on the channel, and that looks unseemly.<\/p>\n<p>But infographics can be divided into a slideshow.\u00a0 Square graphics in a slideshow do not get cropped in the post.<\/p>\n<p>Remember to tag relevant people in the LinkedIn post. Always include a call to action so users know how to react to the post. This will help take them through the lead funnel.<\/p>\n<h3>3.\u00a0\u00a0 Twitter<\/h3>\n<p>Like Facebook, Twitter has courted a lot of controversy over the past few years. But it can still be a good tool to take users through the lead generation funnel.<\/p>\n<p>Many businesses share thought leadership on Twitter which helps them connect with other brands and potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>An infographic post like the below can also lead to increased traffic on one\u2019s site, more than a link with a preview image would.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8698\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Twitter-Infographics.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"312\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Twitter-Infographics.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Twitter-Infographics-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Twitter-Infographics-600x300.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Twitter image sizes are much smaller than other channels\u2014880px by 440px. It\u2019s best to use the exact size because Twitter crops images.<\/p>\n<p>While images can help attract attention, the best way to boost engagement on Twitter now is to create a thread. People love stories online and threads can help marketers create a long story.<\/p>\n<h3>4.\u00a0\u00a0 Pinterest<\/h3>\n<p>Among all the channels, Pinterest is the one that is most conducive to infographics. The vertical format of the platform makes lead acquisition with infographics easier.<\/p>\n<p>It is important to note the current <a href=\"https:\/\/socialmarketingwriting.com\/pinterest-image-sizes-specs\/\">Pinterest image sizes<\/a>\u2014600px by 900px. Even if an infographic like the one below is vertical, it still needs to be sized properly to be viewed by users.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8695\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Pinterest-Inforgraphics.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"936\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Pinterest-Inforgraphics.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Pinterest-Inforgraphics-200x300.png 200w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Pinterest-Inforgraphics-600x900.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What a lot of marketers don\u2019t realize is that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.agorapulse.com\/blog\/pinterest-marketing-help\/\">Pinterest marketing is closer to Google<\/a> than other social platforms.<\/p>\n<p>Pinterest relies on organic search so keywords are important when designing for this channel. Use an <a href=\"https:\/\/loganix.com\/local-seo-checklist\/\">SEO checklist<\/a> for Pinterest posts, as one would do for a blog post.<\/p>\n<p>Also, note that Pinterest doesn\u2019t rely on new content to generate views. With the right keywords, infographics can generate social leads, views, and traffic on the channel for years to come.<\/p>\n<h3>5.\u00a0\u00a0 Instagram<\/h3>\n<p>Instagram still uses square images so marketers can repurpose LinkedIn slideshows for this channel<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/planable.io\/blog\/instagram-story-dimensions\/\">Instagram Story dimensions<\/a> are also great for sharing vertical infographics. Marketers can generate leads by adding engaging elements like stickers and polls to the graphics.<\/p>\n<h3>6.\u00a0\u00a0 Paid Ads<\/h3>\n<p>Infographics can be used in paid ads to generate social media leads. Most marketers know not to use too much text on ads. That\u2019s asking for a lot of labor from users.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, by using a visually appealing infographic, social media ads will have more success.<\/p>\n<p>Infographics can also be divided into carousel ads on multiple channels. But keep the <a href=\"https:\/\/expandi.io\/blog\/linkedin-advertising\/\">ad specs for LinkedIn<\/a>, Facebook, and Twitter in mind before creating the ad.<\/p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>Visuals such as infographics are more important now than ever before. They attract users, boost engagement, and encourage brand loyalty.<\/p>\n<p>We have shared the ways that businesses can generate social media leads in marketing campaigns by using infographics.<\/p>\n<p>Each channel should be treated differently when it comes to infographic use. Make note of the sizes and specs, as well as the needs of the audience before designing visuals.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Author<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8696 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Ronita-Mohan.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"73\" height=\"96\" \/>Ronita Mohan is a content marketer at <a href=\"https:\/\/venngage.com\/\">Venngage<\/a>, the infographic and design platform.
