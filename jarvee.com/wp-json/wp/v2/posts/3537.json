Use Twitter For Observing Your Audience<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3549\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/observing-your-audience.jpg\" alt=\"twitter for business audience\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/observing-your-audience.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/observing-your-audience-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A good rule of thumb in business is to listen to your customer feedback. If not feedback, listen to what exactly are they talking about related to your product or niche.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/analytics.twitter.com\/\">analytics<\/a> gets your job done in regards to what is stated above. It proves itself as a great way to collect data about your audience.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, you can easily understand the concerns and pain points of your audience with a little bit of analysis.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3542 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/twitter-analytics.jpg\" alt=\"tweet activity twitter for business\" width=\"600\" height=\"313\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/twitter-analytics.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/twitter-analytics-300x157.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>However, there&#8217;s more cream to be added on top of that.<\/p>\n<p>And that is Twitter search.<\/p>\n<p>The Twitter search allows you to research on keywords, hashtags or topics.<\/p>\n<p>There is a simple search.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3546\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/twitter-simple-serach.jpg\" alt=\"twitter search for business\" width=\"600\" height=\"181\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/twitter-simple-serach.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/twitter-simple-serach-300x91.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And an Advanced search.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3541 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/twitter-advanced-search.jpg\" alt=\"twitter advanced search for business \" width=\"600\" height=\"356\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/twitter-advanced-search.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/twitter-advanced-search-300x178.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Both are quite self-explanatory so we suggest you get your feet wet a little with their search engine.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter search can be used for different purposes. One of them includes the research of your niches&#8217; audience. Say you type #social media management in the Twitter search. This is what will come up.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3540 \" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/social-media-managment-snippet.jpg\" alt=\"social media management \" width=\"601\" height=\"386\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/social-media-managment-snippet.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/social-media-managment-snippet-300x193.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you can see there&#8217;s quite a bit of data you can gather from here. You can observe what is your audience talking about, other hashtags they are using. Last but not least, you can even curate more content ideas by researching what your audience is sharing!<\/p>\n<p>However, you&#8217;re missing out on a piece of your marketing puzzle, if you haven&#8217;t already placed it.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk more about that in Tactic 2.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Use Images To Tell Stories.<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3547 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/images-to-tell-a-story.jpg\" alt=\"stories with twitter for business \" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/images-to-tell-a-story.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/images-to-tell-a-story-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There is no doubt on the fact that you get more visual context from an image than just a tweet for a link. And when you add a story in your images, you just discovered a formula for success.<br \/>\nWe shed some light on storytelling in this Instagram <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/instagram-marketing-strategy\/\">post<\/a>, it is an insightful, 5-minute read.<\/p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.diygenius.com\/brilliant-examples-of-visual-storytelling-on-instagram\/\">storytelling with photos<\/a> is not limited to Pinterest and Instagram.<br \/>\nYou can advantageously use Twitter to get people to interact and engage with your post.<\/p>\n<p>How? Every brand has a unique way to do so. Some people design images which trigger an emotional response. Some ask a question in an image. Because of the nature of the photo, it is more likely to be seen by more people hence making it more likely for them to respond. This in a way starts a cycle of sharing and response.<\/p>\n<p>Storytelling in photos not only keeps your audience on their toes but it&#8217;s also a creative way to gather data about them. Think about how you can use images to effectively form a story.<\/p>\n<p>Remember to not hard sell. Pictures are not billboards so don&#8217;t treat them like that. The max you should do is soft selling, otherwise, it looks spammy and people will not follow you. Think about what will make someone fascinated or catch their attention. Remember, Seeing is believing.<br \/>\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/5wEjV2ekSwE\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2>3. Use Video On Twitter<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3552 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/use-video-to-tell-a-story.jpg\" alt=\"twitter for business video\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/use-video-to-tell-a-story.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/use-video-to-tell-a-story-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The effectiveness of video marketing has been discussed several times on our blog before. If you still don&#8217;t believe us, then ask yourself a simple question.<\/p>\n<p>Would you rather watch a 3 minute, short and engaging video?<br \/>\nOr would you rather read a 2000 word article shared on social media?<\/p>\n<p>There are many ways to <a href=\"https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/using-twitter\/twitter-videos\">share a video<\/a> on Twitter. You\u00a0have the ability to import a video directly to Twitter for the purpose of sharing. However, an even better feature is the use of Twitter&#8217;s live stream.<\/p>\n<p>The Twitter live stream allows you to record a video for up to 2 minutes and 20 seconds. If you don&#8217;t want to tweet publicly you can also tweet someone directly.<\/p>\n<p>There are many ways to use video marketing on Twitter. For example, many new and smart influencers give their audience a personalized thank you message for following or engaging with them.<\/p>\n<p>Another commonly observed tactic is asking your audience a question\/questions through Twitter video. Since a\u00a0video is more likely to get a response from your audience, you&#8217;ll be able to gather more data from the questions you ask.<\/p>\n<p>You can even share YouTube videos so that they can be watched directly on Twitter. However, try to use this in a sense of either being helpful or being a good storyteller. Don&#8217;t spam your audience with ads.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, if you want to reach a person, be it a great potential influencer for your brand or perhaps someone that you&#8217;re very grateful for on their engagement with your brand, a Twitter video is a great way to make a direct connection with them.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Host Or Participate In A Twitter Chat.<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3543 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/twitter-chat.jpg\" alt=\"twitter for business chat\" width=\"600\" height=\"184\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/twitter-chat.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/twitter-chat-300x92.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Twitter chats are very interesting and super conversational, which is why the engagement level with your audience is quite high.<\/p>\n<p>The high engagement leads to a loyal customer base\/followers and networking opportunities. This makes Twitter chat much more effective compared to other forms of interaction with your audience. So if you have a group of people you want to reach, setting up a schedule for Twitter chat would be a step in the right direction.<\/p>\n<p>You will get to know your audiences&#8217; views, pain points, common queries etc. You can even host an ask-me-anything with your audience to gather data about questions you have in mind.<\/p>\n<p>People really look forward to such interactions. And so should you.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Use Live Stream Platforms Connected To Twitter<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3548 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/live-stream.jpg\" alt=\"twitter for business live\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/live-stream.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/06\/live-stream-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The power of live streaming is that it provides a very unique experience. especially on Twitter. It opens the doors to a lot of opportunities because of the high engagement it offers. Many brands use live streaming for Q&amp;A sessions, webinars, networking or direct interaction with their audience. Before delving into live streaming, research on the different types of platforms that will suit your target.<\/p>\n<p>Each platform has its own unique capabilities. One might be more effective for you than the other. This is why you should educate yourself on all platforms before using them. It may sound like a tedious task but in order to succeed, you must know the dynamics of each platform.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pscp.tv\/\">Periscope<\/a> is a platform that is relatively new and drives great results.<\/p>\n<p>This is a nice introductory video for Periscope.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/NIEH-S5Fmls\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>We highly recommend that you look into different live streaming platforms associated with Twitter, see which one is right for you and set up a live streaming strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter is sometimes overlooked as a marketing platform due to the rise of many other social media sites. However, it still proves to be one of the most effective social media platforms to market on.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It all began with the first tweet in 2006.
