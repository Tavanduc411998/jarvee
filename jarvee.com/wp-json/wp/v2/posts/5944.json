This is the foundation of any brand strategy. The goal is to make your brand relevant and generate awareness. Review your business plan and extract the elements of your product or service that distinguish you from your competition. Check out Interbrand\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brandchannel.com\/\">Brandchannel.com<\/a>, an online exchange that offers free tools and information on a wide variety of branding issues, including how to create a brand and develop brand awareness.<\/p>\n<h2>Create your image.\u00a0<\/h2>\n<p>Your logo and color palette are the visual components of your branding and will appear on all your promotional material. A logo should quickly and efficiently communicate what your business is about. Keep it simple and align it with your brand\u2019s attributes. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.logoworks.com\/\">LogoWorks<\/a> specializes in creating custom logos for small businesses at an affordable price. Base your brand on your customers&#8217; needs. Don&#8217;t know what those are? Ask your customers.<\/p>\n<h2>Get the word out.\u00a0<\/h2>\n<p>Use online and offline channels to get the word out about your brand. Tried and tested methods include the use of promotional items. Branders.com has an extensive catalog of promotional items to help brand your business. Pass along items to customers or hand them out at community events or seminars. Online, you should consider using Twitter, Facebook and blogs to reinforce your brand\u2019s values and attributes. Take a look at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zappos.com\/\">Zappos.com<\/a>, which has earned a lot of praise for its use of the Internet to develop and publicize its brand.<\/p>\n<h2>Be consistent.\u00a0<\/h2>\n<p>As you can probably tell, building a brand means managing multiple endeavors simultaneously. That underscores the importance of staying consistent. Whether you\u2019re dealing with the use of your logo on brochures or how your sales staff pitches your product or service, make sure your brand\u2019s message stays in sync. Create a summary statement or \u201celevator pitch\u201d of your brand: a 30-second synopsis of what it stands for. Make sure your entire staff is aware of it.<\/p>\n<h2>Tips and Warnings<\/h2>\n<p>The best brands tend to appeal to a person&#8217;s natural need and emotions for involvement. Strive for simplicity. Too much information confuses your brand message. Don\u2019t just stress quality and service. Everybody does that. Really figure out what is unique about your product and what sets you apart. Avoid trying to be overly &#8220;cool&#8221; or in-the-moment. That\u2019s too hard to sustain. The brand must be relevant, but long term. The secret to successful brands is not only creating them, but also managing them well.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Everywhere-you-look-there\u2019s-advertising.jpg\" alt=\"Everywhere you look there\u2019s advertising\" width=\"928\" height=\"578\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5946\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Everywhere-you-look-there\u2019s-advertising.jpg 928w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Everywhere-you-look-there\u2019s-advertising-300x187.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Everywhere-you-look-there\u2019s-advertising-768x478.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Everywhere-you-look-there\u2019s-advertising-600x374.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 928px) 100vw, 928px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Everywhere you look, there\u2019s advertising. But is any of it effective? And are advertisers maximizing the space they have to reach people?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In a world that\u2019s becoming increasingly congested with digital messages, it\u2019s simultaneously becoming more difficult for brands to expose themselves to their target markets in engaging and meaningful ways.<\/p>\n<p>Everywhere you look, there\u2019s advertising. But is any of it effective? And are advertisers maximizing the space they have to reach people?<\/p>\n<p>For the most part, the answers to these questions are \u201cno\u201d and \u201cno.\u201d However, there are exceptions.<\/p>\n<p>In the last time, we\u2019ve seen a number of companies, both in the technology and advertising fields, develop new tools and strategies for rising above the noise and enhancing meaningful brand-consumer engagement.<\/p>\n<h3>Balancing Clever and Meaningful<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s a big difference between clever ad placement and meaningful ad placement. Just because a company is targeting customers in a never-before-seen way, doesn\u2019t mean it will be effective or profitable.<\/p>\n<p>Take the following instance as an example.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/permanently-tattooing-the-casino\u2019s-name-on-her-forehead.jpg\" alt=\"permanently tattooing the casino\u2019s name on her forehead\" width=\"583\" height=\"586\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5947\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/permanently-tattooing-the-casino\u2019s-name-on-her-forehead.jpg 583w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/permanently-tattooing-the-casino\u2019s-name-on-her-forehead-298x300.jpg 298w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/permanently-tattooing-the-casino\u2019s-name-on-her-forehead-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In 2005, a Utah woman accepted $15,000 from GoldenPalace.com in return for permanently tattooing the casino\u2019s name on her forehead.<\/p>\n<p>And while Golden Palace\u2019s investment may have brought an initial surge of traffic to its website, mainly from curious people wanting to learn more about the backstory, the long-term value is pretty low.<\/p>\n<p>It may get attention, but this is one unconventional marketing form that won\u2019t take off.<\/p>\n<p>There are plenty of other bizarre stories like this one. There\u2019s the groom that sold ad space on his wedding tie; the man that launched a business based on wearing different branded t-shirts every day of the year; and the movie producer who famously used a homeless man as ad space, but these aren\u2019t anything more than sensational tactics designed to create momentary buzz around an idea or product.<\/p>\n<p>While these certainly represent clever use of advertising space, they are anything but meaningful.<\/p>\n<h3>Clever and Meaningful Use of Ad Space<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Clever-and-Meaningful-Use-of-Ad-Space.jpg\" alt=\"Clever and Meaningful Use of Ad Space\" width=\"925\" height=\"425\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5948\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Clever-and-Meaningful-Use-of-Ad-Space.jpg 925w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Clever-and-Meaningful-Use-of-Ad-Space-300x138.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Clever-and-Meaningful-Use-of-Ad-Space-768x353.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Clever-and-Meaningful-Use-of-Ad-Space-600x276.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>However, there are companies that have been able to produce meaningful engagement with clever placement.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re witnessing a couple of highly relevant examples.<\/p>\n<h2>1. New Outdoor Digital Marketing Boards<\/h2>\n<p>The first one that comes to mind is the Miami Heat\u2019s addition of the Xfinity East Plaza at the American Airline Arena, which brilliantly features digital marketing boards from a company called\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nanolumens.com\/press-releases\/nanolumens-and-the-miami-heat-to-team-up-at-infocomm-2017-for-presentation-on-fan-engagement-in-the-digital-age\/\">Nanolumens<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>These marketing boards allow the Heat to\u00a0advertise on ordinary pillars\u00a0that would have otherwise been blanketed with canvases, or altogether underutilized.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s really an incredible piece of technology and shows how companies are creating and contriving ad space where there formerly was none.<\/p>\n<p>But they aren\u2019t just creating unique ad space as a PR stunt, which was undeniably the primary focus behind the previous strange examples.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s actual value to be extracted from this strategy. By delivering content through previously underutilized space, the Heat organization, its network of advertisers, and the fans are all able to benefit.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Hot Air Balloons<\/h2>\n<p>For years, customers have been exposed to the famous Goodyear Blimp. If a major sporting event is taking place, you can bet the blimp is flying high above the venue.<\/p>\n<p>And while it\u2019s an extremely effective advertising medium for Goodyear, you don\u2019t see many other companies investing in the same strategy.<\/p>\n<p>The primary reason is that a blimp costs millions of dollars to construct.<\/p>\n<p>Well, over the past few years, marketers have discovered ways to bypass this exuberant cost while simultaneously leveraging ad space that was previously underutilized.<\/p>\n<p>They are doing so by purchasing banners and corporate advertisements on hot air balloons.<\/p>\n<p>While it\u2019s not exactly a groundbreaking advertising tactic, companies have sparingly used hot air balloons for decades, it\u2019s growing in popularity thanks to the subsequent growth of social sharing.<\/p>\n<p>As social networking platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have exploded onto the scene, the ability to quickly share images with friends and peers has emerged.<\/p>\n<p>This means the real value of hot air balloon advertising takes place when the image gets recorded and shared hundreds or thousands of times over.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Smartphone Lock Screen<\/h2>\n<p>How many times do you open up your lock screen on your smartphone each day to check the time, read a text, or send an email? If you\u2019re like the average user, you access your lock screen between 30 and 50 times per day.<\/p>\n<p>A study from far 2013 suggests the number could be as high as\u00a0110 times per day\u00a0for the average user.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, this makes it one of the most frequent habitual activities you participate in.<\/p>\n<p>Startup, Slidejoy, noticed this trend and saw what nobody else did, underutilized advertising space. The app, which has received more than $1.2 million in funding, allows brands to deliver advertisements directly to a user\u2019s lock screen. In return, the user can earn roughly $5 to $6 per month.<\/p>\n<p>In the world of adblockers, this could be the answer brands are looking for to tap into the lucrative world of mobile advertising.<\/p>\n<h2>Creating Ad Space Out of Nothing<\/h2>\n<p>As the advertising world becomes noisier and noisier, it\u2019s becoming that much more important for brands to leverage good opportunities for consumer engagement.<\/p>\n<p>Simply paying for the same old PPC ads and physical billboards won\u2019t work for every brand.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, the increased noise means the value of ad space is rising. As a result, venues and individuals are looking for ways to create ad space where none previously existed.<\/p>\n<p>This produces an additional revenue stream and grabs the customer\u2019s attention better than other oversaturated approaches.<\/p>\n<p>In the future we will be look for more creative use of ad space, both in physical and digital marketing.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, look for the rise of wearable marketing. If wearable devices continue to rise in popularity as many market experts predict, then it naturally follows that advertisers will seek out ways to leverage ad space in this niche.<\/p>\n<p>We aren\u2019t quite there, but then again, you never know who will be the first to try something new.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the author<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Kennith Fletcher has five years as a digital marketing strategist, has experience a tech, social media and environmental addict.
