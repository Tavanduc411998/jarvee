Many people prefer to create their own websites so they can share and host all these media files. However, the only problem is that most website hosts don\u2019t provide the bandwidth capabilities and storage options that the large video and audio files require. If you host your own website, you could be risking your credibility and professionalism.<\/p>\n<p>A website that isn\u2019t well equipped could result in slow load times and sometimes page crashes, which would compromise your user experience. Your best bet is to use a podcast hosting platform to share your podcasts with your audience.<\/p>\n<p>Podcast hosting platforms offer enough space for file storage for as long as you need. Most of them will even help you with marketing, making your show more discoverable. Some of these sites can be quite costly though, which is why we\u2019re here to tell you how you can find an affordable podcast hosting platform.<\/p>\n<h2>Compare Platforms<\/h2>\n<p>You can use comparison websites to help you compare between potential podcast hosting platforms. There are many articles that provide thorough comparisons between the top podcast hosting sites. Make sure to read the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.simplecast.com\/5-things-to-consider-when-looking-for-a-podcast-hosting-site\/\">description<\/a> of each website, as well as the features it offers. This way, you\u2019ll know the value you\u2019d be receiving for the price you\u2019re willing to pay. Many cheap platforms are not easy to use and lack core settings and options. This is why it\u2019s important to consider the features that you need the platform to provide, the ones that you\u2019d like to have, and the features you could do without. Don\u2019t pay more money for extra frivolous options that you probably won&#8217;t utilize. For example, extra storage space can cost a lot more, which is why you don\u2019t want to waste money on features you won\u2019t be needing, at least for the time being. Instead, make sure to choose a platform that provides the necessary features and make sure that it has higher packages or upgrade options. This way, when your podcast grows and you need more features, you won\u2019t need to change your podcast host.<\/p>\n<h2>Special Offers<\/h2>\n<p>Did you know that some platforms have special offers that you can receive upon payment or growth? For example, some platforms offer a budgeted gift card with each payment you make. You may be able to extend your free trial on some platforms by using a special link or code. Other platforms give you amazing offers, such as the ability to use custom tools, a tiny extra charge for unlimited or plenty of additional storage space, or access to exclusive partnerships, sponsorships, and networks, when you reach a certain number of downloads. Make sure to find out all the benefits and special offers that potential platforms have to offer. You may even come across a platform that offers amazing special offers for nearly the same price you were going to invest in a different website.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1011091\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/special-offers.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"626\" height=\"417\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/special-offers.png 626w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/special-offers-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/special-offers-600x400.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Promo Codes<\/h2>\n<p>Promo codes are an excellent way to get reduced deals on your selected podcast hosting platforms. This way, you can unlock more options for the same price you were initially paying. You may be surprised to learn that some <a href=\"https:\/\/wiredclip.com\/podbean-coupon-code\/\">podcast promo codes<\/a> may even allow you to upload your podcasts without paying a monthly fee on a few select platforms for a certain period of time. What\u2019s better than a free month of service on a credible, easy-to-use, and fully equipped podcast hosting platform? You can use this opportunity to test drive several features and find out whether they\u2019re worth the extra bucks.<\/p>\n<h2>Free Trials<\/h2>\n<p>If you can\u2019t find a promo code for your desired platform, the chances are that it offers a 7 to 30-day free trial period on a few or all of its services. If you\u2019re willing to take some time to experiment before your show goes online, you can try several hosting platforms out. This way, by the time things get serious, you will have already committed to a platform. Free trials help you find out if you feel comfortable using a platform if it offers an outstanding user experience, and whether it provides all the features you need to take your podcast to the next level.<\/p>\n<h2>Monetization<\/h2>\n<p>Although this isn\u2019t a tactic that helps you get discounts or offers on your desired podcast hosting platforms, it does help you to quickly recover the money you\u2019ve invested in making podcasts. We\u2019re sure you started podcasting because it\u2019s something that you\u2019re passionate about. However, it sure doesn\u2019t hurt to consider the future (and your current expenses) and figure out a way to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/theyec\/2021\/08\/05\/eight-ways-to-monetize-your-podcast\/?sh=1be77ba53e68\">make money<\/a> from your podcasts. Besides, what is better than making a living out of something that you love?<\/p>\n<p>Monetizing a podcast is a relatively new concept. This is why there is no solid technique that helps you make it work, and it\u2019s also particularly why so many hosting sites are still experimenting with the best methods to help their users benefit from the monetization of their podcasts.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re comparing between possible options, make sure to look at each platform\u2019s premium subscription capacities. You also need to find out whether your podcast hosting platform offers beneficial educational resources to help you manage and market your new venture. These features can help you uncover new ways in which you can make money off your show. It also helps to conduct thorough research and read plenty of articles on topics, such as using your podcast to cross-promote other organizations, securing sponsors, and self-marketing. Not only will successful monetization techniques help you break even with your expenses, but you\u2019ll also have enough money to unlock all the features you desire in no time.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1011092\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Monetization.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"626\" height=\"352\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Monetization.png 626w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Monetization-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/Monetization-600x337.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Each podcast hosting platform offers a different set of features and benefits for its users at a unique price. This makes it very hard to choose the best platform for your needs without breaking the bank. This is why many people cut it short and <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/tools-that-will-help-you-build-your-website-without-knowing-how-to-code\/\">build their own websites<\/a> to upload their shows on.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, while it may be more convenient and a lot cheaper, website hosting platforms aren\u2019t equipped to support the needs of podcast shows. Thankfully, there are several ways in which you can find an affordable podcast hosting platform that helps your show grow.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Author<\/h3>\n<p>Robert Turner is an experienced writer who is passionate about creating content that connects brands with their target audience and helps companies increase awareness and realize measurable results.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you\u2019re serious about podcasting, you\u2019ll end up with countless media files that you need to share with your audience.
