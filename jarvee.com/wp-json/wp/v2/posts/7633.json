But do you need a social media strategy to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/233687\">promote your business or events<\/a>? <\/p>\n<h3>Why Event Planners Need a Social Media Strategy<\/h3>\n<p>Aside from being inexpensive or free, social media is a great way to promote events, lead customers to your business or a virtual store where they can purchase event tickets, and is a quick way to find out what\u2019s really important to your customers. However, it should not be used solely to push promotional items or your event services on your audience, but used as a tool to inform, educate, and entertain them. <\/p>\n<p>For example, follow the 10-2-2 \u2018rule\u2019 on your Facebook fan page \u2013 10 entertaining posts, two educational posts, and two sales or promotional posts per week. The main purpose of social media is to build relationships with your perfect client, which will allow you to gain valuable insights and engage with them on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip<\/strong>: if social media overwhelms you, choose one platform at a time and OWN it before moving on to another networking site. I personally love YouTube and offer a free video each week to my subscribers. It\u2019s best to choose a social media site that suits your personality, your business, and your audience; Once you\u2019ve decided which platform works best for you, dedicate time to it and stay involved.<\/p>\n<p>So, what are the 7 creative ways to use Social Media to plan your Events?<\/p>\n<h4>1. Get Their Attention!<\/h4>\n<p>With so many options, our clients are flooded with information and it\u2019s getting harder and harder to stand out from the crowd. To get their attention, make your posts personal and always remember, your audience wants to know \u201cWhat\u2019s In It For Me\u201d, so if it\u2019s not valuable to them then don\u2019t post it. Keep your posts brief, make them personal, and be consistent. Short and sweet is best when it comes to your social media strategy. People respond more when the content interests them and it gets right to the point. After all, most people are on social media sites to be entertained!   <\/p>\n<h4>2. Start Engaging Your Audience<\/h3>\n<p>One of the biggest mistakes you can make when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/sproutsocial.com\/insights\/how-to-get-more-followers-on-twitter\/\">building a Twitter following<\/a> (in my opinion, this applies to any social media site) is to create content and then promote the heck out of it. Instead, give to the network, rather than go out there and sell. The reason why event planners need a social media strategy is to tell a story and to create a community by listening to your fans, asking them questions, and asking for suggestions and feedback \u2013 even if it\u2019s negative.  When someone comments make sure to reply 100% of the time.<\/p>\n<h4>3. Use Pinterest<\/h4>\n<p>Using Pinterest to plan your event is much more creative and visual than traditional methods. Creating a Pinterest board is perfect for brainstorming, and getting all of your creative vision in one place.<\/p>\n<p>Using Pinterest to promote your event also works really well. Pin inspiring photos of the location, guest speakers, sponsors\u2019 logos, and pictures that fit in well with your theme. Photos and videos of past events are another effective option and are a great way of maximizing the hype for your upcoming event.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7637\" style=\"width: 830px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-7637\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/social-media-events-planner.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"820\" height=\"547\" class=\"size-full wp-image-7637\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/social-media-events-planner.jpg 820w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/social-media-events-planner-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/social-media-events-planner-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/social-media-events-planner-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-7637\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Unsplash<\/p><\/div>\n<h4>4. Facebook  contests<\/h4>\n<p>Holding a Facebook contest linked to the event is a wonderful way to reward your Facebook followers and promote your event at the same time; just make sure you\u2019re aware of Facebook\u2019s rules surrounding contests! Asking entrants to share your post as a condition of entry may seem like great PR, but it\u2019s against Facebook\u2019s rules so could cause you problems.<\/p>\n<h4>5. Twitter strategy<\/h4>\n<p>You probably already know that Twitter is fantastic for getting news of your event out there, but do you make full use of its functionality to really make the most of the exposure it can give? It\u2019s easy to set up tweet buttons on your website so visitors can click to tweet a customized message, let everyone know they\u2019re attending, and promote the event at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>Having a real-time Twitter wall displayed at your event isn\u2019t just great promotion; it also helps people at the event connect and network with each other. There are a number of options for Twitter walls, both free and paid, so do some research and decide what will work best for you.<\/p>\n<h4>6. YouTube for event planning<\/h4>\n<p>As we all know, YouTube is a great tool for procrastination, full of funny videos of cats and all the latest music videos (come on, that\u2019s not just me, surely?). If you create a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventsforce.com\/blog\/how-to-use-youtube-for-event-marketing\/\">YouTube channel for your event planning business<\/a>, it becomes one of the wonderfully creative ways to use social media for your events. You can even share your video across your other social media platforms, and visitors to your channel can share it on their own Facebook and Twitter accounts.<\/p>\n<h4>7. Event Hashtag<\/h4>\n<p>The mighty hashtag; used effectively it can maximize the visibility of your event, and it isn\u2019t exclusively used on Twitter anymore. Now other social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram also make use of clickable hashtags to trend words and phrases \u2013 so make your hashtag count! Choose one hashtag that\u2019s memorable, and that relates to your event, as you don\u2019t want to dilute the effectiveness with a number of different hashtags. An example that I could use for an \u2018Event Planning Blueprint Week\u2019 would be #EventBlue. Make sure that you <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/how-to-use-hashtags\/\">use your hashtag<\/a> on everything to do with the event, your website, social media pages and any printed literature.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the author:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>David Hoang works as a copywriter for <a href=\"https:\/\/writeanypapers.com\/custom-writing\/\">customer writing<\/a> service.
