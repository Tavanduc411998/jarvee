Today, digital consumers have an attention span of 10 seconds or less, at most.<\/p>\n<p>The ever-declining attention spans pose a huge challenge for marketers looking to build trust and reputation in the digital space. To effectively pass your marketing message, you have to be incredibly smart else your efforts will always be in vain.<\/p>\n<p>Below are some tried and tested strategies to ensure you engage and win over the attention of current digital consumers.<\/p>\n<h3>Optimize content for mobile phones<\/h3>\n<p>But first, allow us to retrace the evolution of digital consumers over the years. Without a doubt, technology has played an integral role in shaping consumer behaviors. The increased use of smartphones and other handheld devices has redefined how people consume the available information and data. Smartphones have altogether eliminated the need for digital consumers to read every bit of information shared on either a website or social media platform.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no secret that a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/01\/24\/smartphones-72percent-of-people-will-use-only-mobile-for-internet-by-2025.html\">majority of Internet users prefer to consume shared content via their smartphones<\/a>. Nowadays, everyone is addicted to using their handheld devices and these pose a huge distraction as you can quickly navigate from one website to the next.<\/p>\n<p>As a marketer, it&#8217;s in your best interests to perfect means and ways to ensure your audiences stay glued to your shared content. Your marketing strategy should be compelling enough to convince the users to abandon all other sideshows and stay focused on your messages.<\/p>\n<p>When designing your website, you can provide a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adaface.com\/coding-tests\">coding test<\/a> to evaluate your designer\u2019s expertise. With the test, you can know if your developer has the right skills to create a site that&#8217;s properly optimized for mobile devices.<\/p>\n<h3>Scrolling and Scanning is the new norm<\/h3>\n<p>Nowadays, consumers have the convenience of simply scrolling and skimming through the content shared on a website. Gone are the days when these consumers had to read the protracted content shared on webpages.<\/p>\n<p>In the 21<sup>st<\/sup> century, Internet users have the luxury of quickly scanning through the shared content on websites and social media platforms without even paying attention to the nitty-gritty. To win over the hearts and attention of the easily distracted digital consumer, you have to constantly innovate.<\/p>\n<h3>Use Eye-Catching Infographics<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8203\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/infographics.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"624\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/infographics.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/infographics-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/infographics-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/infographics-600x600.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>An effective trick to capture your audiences, either on social media or websites, is by using <a href=\"https:\/\/venngage.com\/blog\/what-is-an-infographic\/\">infographics<\/a>. Infographics allow you to condense vast info and data in a more palatable way. Infographics consisting of illustrations, graphs, and colors offer a splendid way for you to stand out from your competitors.<\/p>\n<p>Research shows that the human brains are more likely to respond to images as opposed to written content. Therefore, instead of using hundreds of words to relay information, simply deploy a flowchart or a pie chart to meet the same goals.<\/p>\n<p>These visual aids work wonders in enhancing the level of interaction with your potential consumers. Marketers are encouraged to use infographics as they convey your authority in a particular field.<\/p>\n<h3>Split your content<\/h3>\n<p>To capture, and retain the consumers\u2019 interests, breakdown your shared content into small bites. Instead of spending hours crafting a lengthy article that very few viewers will get to read, why not split it into distinct parts. Splitting this content confers several advantages: For starters, split content ranks favorably with the various search engines.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, such content is more viewer-friendly and readable to the end-users. For effective results, breakdown your content into short and precise paragraphs. Make use of lists and headers to entice your potential readers to keep on reading your posts.<\/p>\n<h3>Blogger Outreach<\/h3>\n<p>Blogger outreach is an effective strategy for catching the audience&#8217;s attention. Here, you leverage the power of other sites to promote your product or brand. Consumers are more likely to trust and hop on board your brand if it has the endorsement of the websites they follow.<\/p>\n<p>You can secure a <a href=\"https:\/\/linkdoctor.io\/blogger-outreach-services\/\">blogger outreach service<\/a> to get your site more online visibility. With the help of professionals, you can get more backlinks, and your site\u2019s ranking can improve. Search engines often regard websites with lots of backlinks as authoritative, so this approach may <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-to-boost-website-organic-traffic-and-drive-more-revenue\/\">drive valuable traffic<\/a> to your site.<\/p>\n<p>You also have the option to hire an in-house team for this. This may take more of your resources, but you\u2019ll have the option to filter the people you\u2019d want to work with.<\/p>\n<h3>Use Brief and Entertaining videos<\/h3>\n<p>By now, every marketer knows all too well the power of using videos. The present-day social media surfer is more inclined to watch a two-minute video as opposed to reading text content. Invest in <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/video-marketing-insta-stories-and-igtv-for-lead-generation\/\">high-quality and engaging videos<\/a> to convert potential web visitors to reel in more digital audiences. Make sure your shared videos are short, sweet, and purposeful to improve your consumer engagement.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t overdo your video strategy, however. Some marketers make the terrible mistake of having autoplaying videos on their social media pages. Autoplaying videos should be avoided at all costs since they cause your social media pages to become sluggish.<\/p>\n<p>No one wants to waste their precious time waiting for your shared videos to load. By the time these videos completely load, most of your visitors will have shifted their attention elsewhere.<\/p>\n<h3>Research pays<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8204\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/research-on-marketing-strategies.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"416\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/research-on-marketing-strategies.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/research-on-marketing-strategies-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/research-on-marketing-strategies-600x400.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s imperative you do <a href=\"https:\/\/www.infoentrepreneurs.org\/en\/guides\/create-your-marketing-strategy\/\">thorough research before taking on a particular marketing strategy<\/a>. The reason this is important is that each and every digital platform has its unique set of best practices.<\/p>\n<p>Research allows you to make out the subtle ways of expressing your marketing strategies on the different platforms. The marketing strategy that works on Facebook is not necessarily what will deliver on the other social media platforms.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, an ideal tweet contains inviting text combined with a high-quality image and a link. An engaging LinkedIn post, on the other hand, contains detailed information complemented with stunning visuals.<\/p>\n<h3>Create Personal ads<\/h3>\n<p>Personalize your website&#8217;s ads to stand out tall from the millions of competitors. When you&#8217;re creating your ads, always place yourself in the shoes of the potential audiences. Use the various ad targeting tools available to produce personalized and attractive content. PPC&#8217;s are a fantastic way for you to learn the exact needs and wants of your websites or social media account users.<\/p>\n<h3>Influencers Marketing<\/h3>\n<p>Leverage the power of influential bloggers to capture the attention of your potential audiences. Your content is more likely to engage the masses if it has the endorsement of renowned bloggers. Partner up with influencers to enhance your brand&#8217;s outreach. Having an influential blogger retweet your posts helps your websites to rise the search engine rankings while also adding credibility to your message.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Clarity is everything as far as creating actionable and captivating social media content goes. Stick with simple and creative content if you want to capture your audience&#8217;s attention. The modern Internet user dislikes having to strain too hard to get the gist of the message you&#8217;re conveying. Take time to curate clear content if you want a successful marketing outing.<\/p>\n<p>Focus on your brand&#8217;s main selling point by using visual aids and short sentences and paragraphs for assured positive results. Keep on experimenting with new and emerging marketing ploys until you find a winning remedy.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to test and retest your marketing strategies until you finally find the best formula. Use these tips and pointers to spur sustained engagement with your potential consumers and stay competitive in today&#8217;s digital space.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Author<\/h3>\n<p>Daniel Martin loves building winning content teams.
