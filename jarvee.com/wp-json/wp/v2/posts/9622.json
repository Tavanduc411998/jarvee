You\u2019ll learn how to maximize the reach of your video content by making it accessible and optimizing it for your social media network(s).<\/p>\n<p>Finally, we\u2019ll provide some additional resources to help you produce unique and impactful social media video content.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the rules for social media video?<\/h2>\n<p>As with most social media content, there are no hard and fast rules about making an excellent social media video. The one rule most internet marketers agree on, though, is that <em>you should be using video on your social media channels. <\/em><\/p>\n<p>Consumers say video ads are the top way they<strong> discover new brands on social media.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wyzowl.com\/video-marketing-statistics\/\">With 86% of businesses now using video as a marketing tool<\/a><\/u>, it\u2019s essential to keep an eye on the industry and network trends to maximize the impact of your video presence.<\/p>\n<p>Every industry, network, and subnetwork has a unique feed algorithm that causes some videos to go viral while others fall flat. Being aware of what works for your product or service in your network is vital.<\/p>\n<p><strong>As long as you\u2019re doing video as part of your social media strategy, there are no rules for you to break and no consequences for doing things differently. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>However, there are certain things you can do to help your social media video posts perform their best. Best practices vary from network to network, so knowing what works for your network(s) is the most important thing.<\/p>\n<p>On Facebook, you can maximize the engagement of your videos by including a description that isn\u2019t thrifty with words &#8211; <strong>300 characters or more is best. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This gives the user time to get acquainted with your content and be drawn in before the video starts. Finally, to maximize your video\u2019s impact, skip the middleman and <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.quintly.com\/blog\/2017\/03\/facebook-video-study\">post straight to Facebook<\/a><\/u> instead of linking to a video posted somewhere else.<\/p>\n<p>Twitter, on the other hand, requires slightly different tactics to maximize engagement at the post level. Facebook users are drawn in by longer descriptions, while the Tweet that posts your video <u><a href=\"https:\/\/business.twitter.com\/en\/blog\/how-video-is-reshaping-digital-advertising.html\">should be kept short<\/a><\/u> to maximize brand and message recall.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that Twitter began as a micro-blogging platform where <em>\u201cbrevity\u201d <\/em>was taken to the extreme, and users still favor shorter tweets.<\/p>\n<p>There are several things to consider when developing your video posts, and these guidelines are just the beginning. We will continue to discuss more specific ways to increase the impact of your video content on social media below.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How long should videos be?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Believe it or not, you can improve the reach and engagement of your video content on social media just by keeping it to the correct length.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9624\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/how-long-should-videos-be.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"301\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/how-long-should-videos-be.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/how-long-should-videos-be-300x145.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/how-long-should-videos-be-600x289.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Again, there are no complex rules here aside from the maximum video lengths discussed below. However, for every network, there are specific trends in which videos perform better than others.<\/p>\n<p>Each network has an ideal video length to maximize viewers\u2019 engagement with your content. The optimal video length for Facebook across pages of all sizes, for example, is <strong>between 2 and 5 minutes. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Pages with smaller followings may <strong>maintain engagement for up to 20 minutes,<\/strong> while larger businesses will need to keep their videos short.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook ads, however, peak in conversion rates at about 16-20 seconds in length, regardless of business size, unlike general Facebook feed videos. This means that it\u2019s important to consider what kind of video content you\u2019re publishing and not just how long it is.<\/p>\n<p>Above, we discussed that Twitter users are more likely to read shorter blocks of text attached to videos. They also like the videos posted to be shorter.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You\u2019ll get the best engagement from your followers and new viewers on Twitter if your video is <strong>between 20-45 seconds long. <\/strong><\/li>\n<li>TikTok videos perform best at even shorter lengths of 9 to 15 seconds, and Snapchat takes the attention span to an <u><a href=\"https:\/\/businesshelp.snapchat.com\/s\/article\/snap-ads-practices?language=en_US\">absolute minimum, recommending 3-5 seconds<\/a><\/u> of video for maximum impact.<\/li>\n<li>LinkedIn\u2019s user base has a little more variation in the length of video they\u2019re willing to consume, but again, it\u2019s better to be brief here.<\/li>\n<li>Senior audiences, for example, are only willing to watch <strong>about 3 minutes of video to get the information they need<\/strong> to make a decision.<\/li>\n<li>While YouTube allows for the longest video uploads, users still engage more with shorter content of around 2 minutes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>However, you can maximize user engagement even with longer content by knowing your network and your market.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The right kind of videos on YouTube, such as explainers, product demonstrations, and informative content, performs well at any length.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Again, aside from the length and size limits discussed below, there are no real rules when it comes to the length of your content. Knowing the needs of your network and your market is critical.<\/p>\n<p>Across most social media networks, it\u2019s better to get the information in sooner rather than later before your viewers lose interest.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>What does social media video accessibility mean?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Traditional videos are not automatically accessible by people with specific disabilities and audio, visual, or other impairments. You should want to make all of your content accessible to anyone who wants to consume it.<\/p>\n<p><strong> <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9628\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/social-media-video-accessibility.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"468\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/social-media-video-accessibility.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/social-media-video-accessibility-300x225.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/social-media-video-accessibility-600x450.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Taking steps to increase the accessibility of video and other social media posts can extend your reach and help your market get what they need from your business. <\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding<strong> closed captioning<\/strong> to your videos allows viewers (and screen readers) to read the message of your content rather than having to listen to it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This enables users with hearing and attention disabilities to engage with your content and improve access, allowing you to extend your reach. Using infographics and other <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vectornator.io\/blog\/visual-communication\">visual ways of conveying information<\/a><\/u> can also improve accessibility and engagement.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Alt text<\/strong> &#8211; alternative text that describes an image or video &#8211; also improves accessibility for visually impaired people.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To make your content accessible to as many people as possible, you should ensure that your <u><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/9-best-practices-for-writing-youtube-video-description\/\">videos have descriptive text added<\/a><\/u> to the captions wherever there are gaps in a video\u2019s dialogue.<\/p>\n<p>Alt text can include facial expressions, visual descriptions of the setting, and other helpful contextual details.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to providing alt text and closed captioning, you can also supplement your video by providing viewers with a transcript of your video social media posts.<\/p>\n<p>This is easier on some platforms than others, as some networks have character limits for the text posts accompanying your videos. If this is a problem, you can provide a <u><a href=\"https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/\">shortened hyperlink<\/a><\/u> to a page with the transcript.<\/p>\n<p>Whether or not your followers have a disability that necessitates the use of captions and alt text, however, it\u2019s still a best practice to optimize your video for viewing without sound.<\/p>\n<p>85% of all Facebook video views in 2016 <u><a href=\"https:\/\/digiday.com\/media\/silent-world-facebook-video\/\">happened with the sound off<\/a><\/u>, and many users browse Facebook with their devices on silent. Relying solely on your video\u2019s audio can cause you to lose some viewers almost instantly, no matter how high quality your content is.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Beyond the audio in your video, it\u2019s also important to consider the readability of your text and images. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The text should be legible, and colors should have sufficient contrast to be easily distinguishable from one another so that those with both audio and visual impairments can enjoy your content.<\/p>\n<p>By providing alternate ways for your users to access your content, you can improve their user experience and maximize the impact of your social media videos.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to optimize video for social media?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you want to give your content the best possible chance of performing well, it\u2019s essential to consider more than just the optimal length of the video.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9626\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/optimize-video-for-social-media.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"483\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/optimize-video-for-social-media.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/optimize-video-for-social-media-300x232.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/optimize-video-for-social-media-600x464.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are general rules, guidelines, and trends that you should be aware of when creating your content for each network.

Some of these are related to the viewing experience within their websites and apps and are necessary for users to view your content easily.<\/p>\n<p>Other recommendations are about viewer engagement and maybe less technical or may make use of unique native features of the app.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Facebook recommends<\/strong> that videos posted on its platform have H.264 compression, stereo AAC audio compression at 128kbps or higher, a fixed frame rate, and square pixels. In general, videos shot in portrait mode <strong>(9:16 aspect ratio)<\/strong> and square videos (<strong>1:1 aspect ratio)<\/strong> perform better than videos in landscape mode on this platform.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Instagram automatically compresses photos and videos<\/strong> when you upload them, which saves most users time but can be problematic for some videos. If you want to process your own Instagram videos, they recommend a frame rate of <em>30 FPS.<\/em> Videos can be square, portrait, or landscape, but square videos perform best across the board.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Snapchat recommends<\/strong> you should aim to keep the top margins of your video clear of graphics, logos, or other distracting details that could overlap with your user information.<\/li>\n<li><strong>LinkedIn recommends<\/strong> businesses post portrait-mode videos whenever landscape isn\u2019t necessary, as users would rather not have to rotate their phones.

This way, users will logically flow from one video to the next relevant piece of content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As you can tell from various guidelines and recommendations from each social network\u2019s platform, you must know the formats and limits for your preferred networks.<\/p>\n<p>Trying to post the same type of video to each network will give you weak results on most.
