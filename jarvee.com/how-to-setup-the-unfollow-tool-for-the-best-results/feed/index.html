					<description><![CDATA[Just don&#039;t go over 200 follow and unfollow actions per day and you&#039;re safe. I have tried multiple tactics and my conclusion is to avoid big follow and unfollow numbers on a daily basis, that&#039;s the key.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that the combination of a daily follow and unfollow actions is the right way of using these tools because it&#039;s more human like behavior. Automatic follow/unfollow option is the one i prefer, You can set it on daily basis, but it&#039;s better to leave couple of days to your followings to see would they follow You back.]]></description>
