					<description><![CDATA[Interesting information, thank you Jarvee team. These can be useful if you are a beginner on some social network or don&#039;t know how your potential audience behaves. After some time, when you see learn about your followers and how they &quot;breathe&quot; you will be able to see based on your experience and previous posts what type of posts were their favorite and if they had more or less characters.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jarvee.com/how-long-should-your-social-media-content-be/#comment-996&quot;&gt;Vladimir&lt;/a&gt;.

Thank for your input Vladimir, yes you&#039;re right it sounds strange and it&#039;s quite counter-intuitive. However people are quite busy or better say bored nowadays so they don&#039;t really want to spend too much time on any one thing unless it&#039;s super interesting for them. And as most things people post aren&#039;t, the only way to make sure they read/view everything is to keep it super short.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry, but some of these things don&#039;t make much sense. You should create shorter posts on Facebook and G+ than on Twitter, even though the latter is actually designed for short, brief messages? Also, I think 3 minutes on YouTube are not enough for more than to say hello and goodbye.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great post Adam,

I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve read about this elsewhere before, even though I know that a lot of people have written about it before on the internet, but this is the first time I&#039;m taken my time to read it. 

Funny enough, many people do not know about this social media content length. And it&#039;s good the way you covered it for better understanding.

Thanks for sharing.]]></description>
