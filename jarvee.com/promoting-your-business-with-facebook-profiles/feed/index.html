					<description><![CDATA[Hi

I have a few questions about this

1. Is this guide still valid and working? Any updates to it?

2. Is it possible to add country location filters to the &quot;Search &#038; Add Friends Tool&quot; So like if I only wanted to send requests to users located in the United States?

3. Is this different than using the Contact&#062;Friend Request tool? Like can I use the same fast settings on the Contact&#062;Friend Request tool or will that not work for this fast adding trick?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://jarvee.com/promoting-your-business-with-facebook-profiles/#comment-117603&quot;&gt;Rav&lt;/a&gt;.

Hello Rav,

The article was written while FB still used the old design. Now, with the new design, the URL of the post&#039;s reaction is not available, however, we took care of that. 
All you need to do is:

1. While on FB: 
- Click the right mouse button on the post&#039;s publishing time
- Copy the URL of the post (we&#039;ll find reactions).
Click below to see the screenshot and understand better what exactly I refer to:
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CvBNSd7.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc&quot;&gt;Facebook Post URL copy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

2. Open Jarvee and go to Tools for preferred FB account, then follow these steps:
- go to the &quot;Search and Add friends&quot; tool. 
- Click on the Sources tab
- Check the box next to &quot;Pages and Page post.
- Paste the URL of the post on and click on Add to list.

3. Start the tool and Jarvee will do the rest.]]></description>

Most of it, yes, but Instagram is even more strict now. Anyway, we found some solutions and implemented them in Jarvee. Just send message to support, let them know you&#039;re getting blocks and they&#039;ll show you what options to use in order to avoid it.]]></description>

Yes same with me. I create an account on a phone with 4G and a phone number and after 1 friend request it gets photo verification. @Bruce Is there anything else you are doing differently to make this work?]]></description>

Hi, thanks for the comment.

1. I believe you can use same phone for 2-3 accounts, but don&#039;t do more.

2. You can add all accounts as administrators of the group/s, just to be safe in case one of them gets suspended.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,
Thanks for your post it´s very useful.
I have a couple of questions about this method:
1. The method to create the FB account, can I create many more accounts with the same mobile or the method is only to create another one?
2. You say that we create a group and invite all friend to this group but then... do I need to add all my FB accounts as admin of the FB group to use the &quot;auto-invite friends to your groups&quot; function of Jarvee or the FB accounts invite to their friends to the group from DM and link to the FB group?

Best regards.]]></description>
