It has over 722 million members spread across the globe in more than 200 countries and territories. <\/p>\n<p>Instagram started the trend called \u201cStory\u201d or \u201cStories\u201d where you can post daily content in the form of a picture, a video, or even a sentence. These posts last for just 24 hours. <\/p>\n<p>Facebook followed suit by releasing their own version of Stories called &#8220;My Day,&#8221; but is more commonly referred to as Facebook Stories. Finally, Twitter&#8217;s version is called &#8220;Fleet.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>LinkedIn recently added the same feature to its app. Think of it as a content marketing strategy that you can use to get more LinkedIn followers as they get to know more about your business or your brand.<\/p>\n<p>LinkedIn Stories can be seen as a tool to reach out to your followers. You can post anything on it including a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dotcomdollar.com\/how-to-start-a-blog\/\">link to a blog you started<\/a> to reach a wider audience. <\/p>\n<p>If you do not have the time to manage multiple social media accounts, you can choose to <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/linkedin-marketing-automation-features\/\">automate your posts<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>This article will give you various tips and tricks to pump up your revenue using LinkedIn Stories as part of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freedomtoascend.com\/entrepreneurship\/what-is-a-sales-funnel\/\">sales funnel<\/a>, which is important to gain a business advantage.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/linkedin-stories-for-business.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"567\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8056\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/linkedin-stories-for-business.jpg 850w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/linkedin-stories-for-business-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/linkedin-stories-for-business-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/linkedin-stories-for-business-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>9 Useful Tips and Tricks (Stories Strategy) on How to Use LinkedIn Stories for Your Business<\/h2>\n<h3>#1 Encourage Thought Leaders to Give Professional Tips<\/h3>\n<p>Whether it\u2019s from you, your HR, or your top-performing employee, giving free professional tips such as resume advice, creative design perspectives or increasing productivity helps you capture your followers\u2019 attention. Posting these tips on your LinkedIn Stories makes it easier for you to reach out to your audience.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/help\/linkedin\/answer\/119761\">Sharing a story<\/a> is simple but is a strong way to start gathering the attention of people who look into your company. Just make sure that they are not all crammed in a single slide of a story. Keep it simple to help make it easier for your audience to appreciate every slice of the cake.<\/p>\n<h3>#2 Be part of a LinkedIn Group<\/h3>\n<p>LinkedIn has a feature where you can be a part of a group. Becoming a member of groups that are related to your niche helps you become more visible. It also gives you an opportunity to interact with like-minded people or companies that you could potentially partner with.<br \/>\nYou can also create your own group if you want to. Either way, this can also help you expand your professional network.<\/p>\n<h3>#3 Share Real-Time Event Updates<\/h3>\n<p>Using LinkedIn Stories to showcase your brand\u2019s live events helps the audience see how much you value your people, from your employees down to the consumers themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Posting live events such as awards ceremonies, product announcements, or even simple expressions of gratitude to your consumers help build trust and hype for your company brand.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever your business provides, real-time events is a good marketing strategy to maximize.<\/p>\n<h3>#4 Host a Question and Answer for your Customers<\/h3>\n<p>You may ask your customers to submit questions they may have for your company. This helps build more trust from your customers, as they are given the chance to know more about your products. Traditionally, Q and A sessions are done using some type of <a href=\"https:\/\/colinshipp.com\/best-webinar-software\/\">webinar software<\/a>, but with LinkedIn stories, you can have simpler, text-based Q &#038; A\u2019s for your customers.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, you can also post questions for your customers to answer. It helps you show that you care about your customers\u2019 thoughts and feedback for a product you have in mind. At the same time, it helps you understand your audience deeper so that you can tweak your products a bit to further meet their needs.<\/p>\n<p>It also makes your customers see how engaging your company is when it comes to your customer needs. It builds a foundation for a more concrete relationship between you and your customers.<\/p>\n<h3>#5 Share News and Announcements of New Products or Special Offers<\/h3>\n<p>Got a new product in line? Do you have plans to give discounts and special offers in the near future? Any good news about your company\u2019s future expansions happening? There are many good platforms to showcase them, but using LinkedIn Stories is a quick, easy, and more accessible way for your customers to receive your message.<\/p>\n<p>LinkedIn Stories is a convenient way to easily catch your customers\u2019 curiosity, and so using it to post a sneak peek of a new product you plan to release, or an upcoming event with special offers, great deals, and special discounts is a sure-fire way to increase your sales.<\/p>\n<h3>#6 Highlight Product Strengths<\/h3>\n<p>You may also use LinkedIn Stories to further emphasize what your products do, and how they can help the consumers in their daily lives. This gives you the chance to showcase your products in the quickest way.<\/p>\n<p>If you sell products on any of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adamenfroy.com\/ecommerce-platforms\">eCommerce platforms available<\/a>, using LinkedIn Stories can help drive traffic to your account and increase your chances of closing a deal. <\/p>\n<h3>#7 Share Customer Testimonials<\/h3>\n<p>Did you receive a couple of good feedback from people who recently bought your products? LinkedIn Stories can be used to showcase recent testimonials from customers who have recently messaged you on how your products have helped them.<\/p>\n<p>Posting positive feedback from customers helps guarantee your products and services to other new potential buyers who are looking for what you\u2019re selling.<\/p>\n<h3>#8 Do Not Overshare<\/h3>\n<p>This should be common sense, but I just wanted to include this here to serve as an echo chamber. LinkedIn is a professional site, so using LinkedIn Stories should be treated as if it were your business card. Do not post selfies, pictures of your lunch, and other things irrelevant to your brand.<\/p>\n<h3>#9 Do Not Overthink It<\/h3>\n<p>Keep it simple, precise, but eye-catching. Do not put a lot of things in it. We live in modern times where minimalism is the trend. This means that the more you overdo it, the worse it becomes. With that said, know your brand\u2019s key points to help you decide what to share and what not to.<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/help\/linkedin\/answer\/119760\/linkedin-stories-overview?lang=en\">LinkedIn Stories<\/a> is a fresh and easy feature that is pretty much like Instagram Stories. You can take advantage of it to further help your business or brand grow bigger if you learn how to maximize it. It is a powerful marketing tool to whoever possesses the knowledge on how to use it.<\/p>\n<p>Once you grasp the essence of LinkedIn Stories, sailing through it will be a breeze. Your audience will begin noticing the stories you share. They will start talking about it, and then they will start to expand. Rinse and repeat until you reach the point where your products and services speak for themselves with little to no marketing.<\/p>\n<h4>Author Bio<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Hanson Cheng<\/strong> is the founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.freedomtoascend.com\/\">Freedom to Ascend<\/a>.
