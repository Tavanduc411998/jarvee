Sending out an email can be as simple as sending a tweet! Not only that, but with technology being what it is now, you can even do it on your phone or tablet. Email is also inexpensive and fast to operate, so if you want to get more sales, online sales are where it&#8217;s at.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/why-email-marketing-is-still-not-dead-in-2021\/\">Email marketing is a simple yet cost-effective method<\/a> to reach potential customers and clients. What makes it so great for your business? Consider just how many channels, campaigns, and templates you can make with email marketing, unlike other marketing tools. A whopping<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.litmus.com\/resources\/email-marketing-roi\/\"> ROI of 4200%<\/a><\/u> makes emails one of the practical and effective tools for marketing.<\/p>\n<p>You might think that one standardized template will do the trick. The truth is that your emails might not be as effective as you desire. The reason for this is that a majority of recipients are so used to formal business emails with boring content and mundane formatting structures that your average emails tend to get overlooked.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we will discuss the elements that will help improve the readability of your next email campaign and engage more users in clicking on links or purchasing your products\/services.<\/p>\n<h2>How To Make Your Emails Attractive &amp; Interactive?<\/h2>\n<h3>1) Structure<\/h3>\n<p>Having a defined structure for email is key to ensuring that it will maximize the attention of your viewers. Establish a hierarchy with bright colors and boxes representing different sections &#8211; like navigation, menus, search bars, etc. If you happen not to have design skills or find yourself lacking inspiration, turn to someone who does \u2013 the more clever and original your overall design, the better people will respond!<\/p>\n<p>Think of templates as boxes. The different colors usually come first, then pictures, logos, and images. Let the words fill up the rest of the space in between what you see here. Usually, there&#8217;s a lot of space above the fold to add eye-catching features that can keep readers curious. It&#8217;s great to experiment with this space to create irresistible calls to action!<\/p>\n<h3>2) Colour combination<\/h3>\n<p>Much like a painting, each palette you select for your email marketing campaign has the potential to elicit a precise emotional response and help you to paint a picture in the imagination of your subscriber. It&#8217;s essential to use images that resonate with the colors you choose and make sure they&#8217;re aligned with your other choices like fonts and general layout too.<\/p>\n<p><u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ceotodaymagazine.com\/2018\/01\/colour-increases-brand-recognition-by-80-but-how-many-brands-can-you-recognise\/\">According to a study<\/a><\/u>, color increases brand recognition by up to 80%, and it makes sense. Think about the brands that are most successful according to you &#8211; all of them are associated with certain colors. For example: Adobe = Red Stripe, Caterpillar = Yellow, Starbucks = Green IBM &amp; Hewlett-Packard (HP) = Blue Twix.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9944\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Color-combination.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"453\" height=\"269\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Color-combination.png 453w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Color-combination-300x178.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Determine your branding colors and understanding if you are going to feature one primary color, or will you be mixing it up? When crafting emails that look visually appealing, you have to stick with your brand colors. And when it comes to things like images, be sure not to ignore them! According to a study done by MailChimp, &#8220;sending emails without an image can result in approximately a 13% drop in open rate and 31% decrease in click-through rates.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>3) Make a brand identity<\/h3>\n<p>Fonts, colors, and imagery all make up an individual&#8217;s brand identity. Your job is to ensure everything is perfectly consistent across all your online channels so that the company can be recognized both contextually and visually by potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>Make use of an <u><a href=\"https:\/\/newoldstamp.com\/blog\/email-signature-marketing-guide\/\">email signature marketing<\/a><\/u> campaign which is generally a company logo or banner that you can find below the contact details on an individual&#8217;s email signature. This is a great and inexpensive way to get more out of your employees&#8217; daily written correspondence: attract new customers, drive traffic to your website, create great call-to-actions, grow brand awareness, and much more!<\/p>\n<h3>4) Strong CTA<\/h3>\n<p>Call to action is effective when they help you reach your marketing goals. Therefore, they need to clearly communicate what action you want your subscribers and prospects to take. After your audience reads your email copy, they might ask a question such as &#8220;So now what?&#8221; which your Call to Action should answer without leaving any scope for doubt.<\/p>\n<p>One of the best ways to stand out and ensure a lasting relationship with your customers, clients, and partners is by sending them a personalized <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bonjoro.com\/blog\/post\/6-thank-you-video-examples-and-scripts-you-can-use\">thank you video<\/a><\/u>. Sending a card may be easy for some people, but we all know that life can get in the way, which sometimes makes it difficult to catch up over coffee or anything else. A custom video has been shown to have better results than text when it comes to reaching someone emotionally, so let that be your first option instead of searching for different ways to express how awesome they are!<\/p>\n<h3>5) Mobile-friendliness<\/h3>\n<p>A significant part of your subscribers currently accesses information from their mobile devices. You must ensure that all elements in your email are legible on a mobile device and can be read without having to zoom into anything. The layout should be flexible so that your email looks stunning on all types of screen sizes as it would if it was just viewed on a regular-sized monitor.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9946\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/mobile-friendly.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"524\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/mobile-friendly.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/mobile-friendly-300x291.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/mobile-friendly-600x582.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Imagine you have an email list of readers. Think of how your content might appeal to them if it was written responsively. If you adapt the content of your emails for mobile devices, multiple columns on a page will transform into one when accessed through a smartphone. Don&#8217;t forget that different software allows users to turn this button off or on at their discretion.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>You don&#8217;t necessarily have to put too much effort into creating beautiful emails for succeeding in email marketing. There is no shortage of tools in the market that can help you get the exact result you want. You can take inspiration from the templates and keep brand identity in mind while also remembering how important clarity is when it comes to messaging.<\/p>\n<p>Take advantage of visual elements, like images and colors, as well as smart CTAs that will resonate with your audience. Try using numbers, charts, and diagrams wherever possible, keeping in mind their effects on your brand image. Arranging content blocks in an order that makes the most sense is also a great way to ensure successful email marketing.<\/p>\n<p>When your email is ready, send out a few test versions to colleagues and wait for the results to show in your dashboard.
