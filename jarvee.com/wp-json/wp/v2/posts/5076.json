With time, Facebook&#8217;s algorithm got more strict and these ways of promotions, although still possible to be done on a smaller scale, aren&#8217;t bringing results as they used to.<\/p>\n<p>However, if there is a will there is a way. One of the latest strategies that we&#8217;re bringing to you in this post is how to promote your business, website or page with Facebook profile\/s (one or more).<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/facebook-profile-marketing.jpg\" alt=\"facebook profile marketing\" width=\"647\" height=\"482\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5111\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/facebook-profile-marketing.jpg 647w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/facebook-profile-marketing-300x223.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/facebook-profile-marketing-600x447.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Important info:<\/strong> don&#8217;t use your real (personal) Facebook profile for this purpose since this is at least a greyhat method.<\/p>\n<p>When you go through your Facebook newsfeed, you&#8217;ll notice that most posts that you see are either from your friends or actually Facebook ads and just in rare cases, you&#8217;ll see a post from a Facebook page that you liked sometimes in the past.<\/p>\n<p>So the whole idea behind the this strategy is to get 5000 friends on your Facebook profile and share you posts there. This way there&#8217;s higher chance that your friends will see the posts, like it, click on it, make a purchase, or whatever you want them to do. Aside from that, the posts from friends appear a little bit more personal and trustful to Facebook users than the posts from FB Pages or advertisements.<\/p>\n<p>What we&#8217;ll show you in this article is:<\/p>\n<p>1. How to create bulletproof a Facebook profile &#8211; a profile that FB won&#8217;t ban or block after a couple of actions<br \/>\n2. How to get 5000 targeted friends by using Jarvee<br \/>\n3. How to scale it up<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s start.<\/p>\n<h2>Creating a bulletproof Facebook profile<\/h2>\n<p>After a lot of testing, we came to the conclusion that best profiles are those created with a phone number (instead of an email address). So, for a new profile, you will need a new phone number. You can use virtual ones (just make sure they work with Facebook), but it&#8217;s best to use physical sim cards (real phone numbers).<\/p>\n<p>Another important thing that you have to pay attention to, is using the Facebook mobile application to create the account. The simplest way of doing this is to download Facebook Lite application (official FB app for Android or iOS) and create a new account. This way you won&#8217;t be messing with your main Facebook account and full FB application that you probably have on your phone.<\/p>\n<p>After installation, click on Create New Account (Sign up) and add your new phone number. Set your password and you&#8217;re good to go. In some cases, Facebook will send you an SMS with a code (to the new phone number used for the account creation) that you&#8217;ll use to confirm your account. This will make your account more natural and FB will give it more trust.<\/p>\n<p>After you&#8217;ve done the steps above, make sure you fill your profile, add your birth date, your profile photo and cover photo. A good idea is to share a couple of posts from trustful websites, maybe add some pics or post some text statuses too. All this is done in order to get your profile accepted as a friend easier by Facebook profiles that you&#8217;ll be sending your friend requests to.<\/p>\n<p>All done? Good. Let&#8217;s go to next step.<\/p>\n<h2>How to get 5000 targeted friends by using Jarvee<\/h2>\n<p>You might think Facebook will never let you add 5000 friends easily and in a short period of time, but in fact, there is a way to accomplish this. If you would go from profile to profile clicking on ADD FRIEND button, you would probably get blocked pretty fast, but there is one way that Facebook does not monitor that much, and this way allows you to add a lot of friends, 1000 of them daily. Best of all, these friends will be highly targeted and interested in your niche, so when you post or share something to your Facebook wall, there&#8217;s a high chance the Facebook algo will actually show it in their newsfeed &#8211; from there, they will like it, click on it or do something else that will benefit your business, webiste or page.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you have a website in the fashion niche and you want to promote it with your newly created Facebook profiles. First you need to add targeted FB friends. The way to accomplish this without being blocked by Facebook is to find big Facebook pages in the fashion niche, check their posts, find those posts with the most reactions (likes) and copy the reactions URL. A post reactions URL looks like this:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ufi\/reaction\/profile\/browser\/?ft_ent_identifier=ZmVlZGJhY2s6ODU1NTc4ODExMjc5ODQ1&amp;av=100017003628188<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>To get it, follow the instructions below:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Right click on the number of reactions (marked as 1 in screenshot below)<\/li>\n<li>Click on &#8220;Copy link address&#8221; (marked as 2 in screenshot below).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5088 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2019-09-10_20h08_09.png\" alt=\"Adding Friends from Facebook reactions\" width=\"739\" height=\"437\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2019-09-10_20h08_09.png 739w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2019-09-10_20h08_09-300x177.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2019-09-10_20h08_09-600x355.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 739px) 100vw, 739px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you visit the reactions URL, you will see the list of Facebook users who reacted to that post and next to each of them, or at least most of them, there will be Add Friend button. The catch is, when you click on Add Friend button from here, Facebook doesn&#8217;t block you, even if you add 100&#8217;s of friends per day. Of course, you will still have to wait for them to accept your request. Acceptance rate in our test cases was between 20%-30%. In some cases, you will get message from Facebook to &#8220;avoid adding people you don&#8217;t know personally&#8221; or to confirm that you know the person you&#8217;re trying to add. Regarding the first message, you can ignore it and just click on Close button. In the second case, all you have to do is confirm it. This is important if you are doing it manually, but since you&#8217;ll be using Jarvee and it will do all this work for you automatically, you don&#8217;t have to worry about it.<\/p>\n<p>What you need to pay attention to, is how many reactions posts have. Don&#8217;t add URL&#8217;s of reactions with posts that have only 50-100 likes, make sure there are more. Of course, make sure you find multiple URL&#8217;s, not just one, so Jarvee has sources to work with.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get to Jarvee and find out how to add these reactions URL&#8217;s to sources.<\/p>\n<p>Go to your Facebook Profile&#8217;s Tools section &gt; Search and Add Friends Tool (No 1) &gt; Sources tab (N0 2). Check &#8220;Custom URL box&#8221; (No 3) and paste all reactions URL&#8217;s that you&#8217;ve gathered in text below (No 4 in screenshot). It should look like this:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-5089 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2019-09-10_20h10_13.png\" alt=\"Facebook reactions - Adding sources - Friends\" width=\"1290\" height=\"558\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2019-09-10_20h10_13.png 1290w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2019-09-10_20h10_13-300x130.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2019-09-10_20h10_13-768x332.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2019-09-10_20h10_13-1024x443.png 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2019-09-10_20h10_13-600x260.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1290px) 100vw, 1290px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now your Search and Add Friends tool is almost ready to go. Let&#8217;s go back to its Settings tab to set it up.<\/p>\n<p>As we said in one of the paragraphs above, Facebook doesn&#8217;t have any restrictions when adding friends this way so it&#8217;s really up to you how you will set up the tool. For safety reasons, we&#8217;ll set it up to add 500 friends per day.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5090 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2019-09-10_20h17_58.png\" alt=\"Search and Add Friends Jarvee Tool settings\" width=\"1112\" height=\"491\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2019-09-10_20h17_58.png 1112w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2019-09-10_20h17_58-300x132.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2019-09-10_20h17_58-768x339.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2019-09-10_20h17_58-1024x452.png 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/09\/2019-09-10_20h17_58-600x265.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1112px) 100vw, 1112px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In the screenshot above, you can see that we set up Jarvee to execute Search and Add friends operation every 240 &#8211; 480 seconds and send 30 &#8211; 90 friend requests to Facebook users during each operation. Maximum daily limit is set to 450 &#8211; 550 friend requests. Although we did have success with up to 1000 friend requests per day, we won&#8217;t recommend you to use so aggressive settings.<\/p>\n<p>With the parameters in the screenshot, Jarvee should send about 500 requests pretty fast and your profile will be able to execute other operations during the rest of the day. In about 10 days or so, you should have a profile with a decent audience (number of friends) and you can start publishing your posts there. Keep in mind that not all people will accept your friend requests immediately and also that some of them will reject your requests.<\/p>\n<h2>How to scale it up?<\/h2>\n<p>Scaling up is pretty simple. So far we&#8217;ve talked about just one profile, so, the logical way of scaling up everything is creating multiple profiles and using Jarvee&#8217;s Search and Add Friends tool to get 5000 targeted friends on each of them. Of course, you should pay attention on the sources that you are using on each profile so you don&#8217;t end up with the same friends on all of them.<\/p>\n<p>Math is simple, 10 Facebook profiles with 5000 friends each and you got yourself audience of 50 000 highly targeted Facebook users who actually care about what you are going to post.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bonus tip:<\/strong> Create Facebook group (related to your niche) and start inviting all those friends from each profile to your group. Share <strong>posts from your profile to group<\/strong>.\u00a0This should give your posts some more exposure. However, Facebook is more strict when you are inviting friends to group so you should limit these actions to 50 &#8211; 100 invites per day, and of course, spread it during the day.<\/p>\n<p>If you have any suggestions or questions related to Jarvee&#8217;s Search and Add Friends tool, feel free to contact us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For a long time, promoting your business, website, Facebook page or anything similar was done only by growing your Facebook pages, groups or sharing your page&#8217;s posts to groups.
