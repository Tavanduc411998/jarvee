They allow you to send your customers super-relevant, super-timely messages based on how they interact with your website.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, we\u2019ll be helping you to do the same by sharing exactly what triggered emails are, how we set them up (and how you can too), and the tools we use to deliver them.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s get started!<\/p>\n<h2>What are trigger emails?<\/h2>\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8952\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/what-is-trigger-emails.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"358\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/what-is-trigger-emails.png 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/what-is-trigger-emails-300x168.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/what-is-trigger-emails-600x336.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.engagebay.com\/blog\/trigger-email-marketing\/\">Trigger emails<\/a> are automated, conditional, and contextual emails (or email sequences) that are sent in response to specific actions\/behaviors. These actions might include joining your mailing list, making a purchase, viewing a specific page, or any number of other things!<\/p>\n<p>The premise behind it is simple: <strong>If a user does X, send them Y<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>It works like this:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>You create different emails or email sequences that are laser-targeted to different customer segments<\/li>\n<li>You set up conditions based on customer actions to trigger those emails.<\/li>\n<li>Whenever those conditions are met by a customer, they receive an email to their inbox with a timely, relevant message.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The reason trigger emails work so well is that different customers will respond better to different types of emails depending on where they are in your <u><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-to-create-a-sales-funnel-specifically-for-your-business-on-the-social-network\/\">sales funnel<\/a><\/u>.<\/p>\n<p>For example, let\u2019s say a customer has just bought a product on your website. They\u2019re now in the post-purchase <u><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-to-effectively-incorporate-customer-journey-mapping-into-your-marketing-strategy\/\">stage of the customer journey<\/a><\/u>, so the goal with that user is no longer to nurture them towards making a purchase.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, the focus switches to ensuring customer satisfaction and earning return business. As such, you might set up a triggered email sequence to send them a confirmation email, product support\/guidelines, or recommendations for other related products.<\/p>\n<p>This is a very simple example of a triggered email campaign, but there are literally endless use cases and combinations.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, we&#8217;re going to share some of our favorites.<\/p>\n<h3>Before you get started<\/h3>\n<p>In order for these tactics to work, you\u2019re going to need emails &#8211; while growing your list is outside of the scope of this guide, <u><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/easy-ways-to-get-more-people-to-subscribe-to-your-email-list\/\">this is a good place to start<\/a><\/u>.<\/p>\n<h2>Types of triggered email campaigns<\/h2>\n<p>Here are some of our favorite types of trigger-based email campaigns and how we use them to improve user experience, increase conversions, and offer timely support.<\/p>\n<h3>Number of website visits<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8947\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/number-of-website-visits.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"456\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/number-of-website-visits.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/number-of-website-visits-300x214.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/number-of-website-visits-600x428.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The number of times a user visits your website is a good indication of how interested they are in what you have to offer, so it makes sense to use this to tailor your message to different segments of your audience based on how interested they are.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if a user visits your website twice a week, it\u2019s probably a sign that they\u2019re responding positively to your website or services, so you might want to email them more frequently than someone who has only visited your website once.<\/p>\n<h3>How to use this:<\/h3>\n<p>A big use case for this trigger is increasing email frequency &#8211; if a non-customer is browsing more frequently then we make sure to email them regularly and maybe bump up the number of messages they get per week.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if a customer is back browsing the site, you might try alerting your customer support team to reach out directly to see if we can offer any assistance.<\/p>\n<h3>Page or blog category deep dive<\/h3>\n<p>Another way to use triggered emails is to send your users more of the specific kind of content that they\u2019re interested in. You can determine what they\u2019re interested in based on how they\u2019re consuming content on your website.<\/p>\n<p>Most websites organize their posts and pages via \u2018categories\u2019 that help link topics together. For example, the Jarvee blog uses categories like Facebook Marketing, Instagram Marketing, SEO, Sales Tips, etc.<\/p>\n<p>The idea is that if a user is spending an increased amount of time in a certain category, you want to nurture that and send them more of what they\u2019re interested in.<\/p>\n<h3>How to use this:<\/h3>\n<p>To illustrate how we use this trigger, let\u2019s look at 2 different examples:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>A user reads 3+ articles from the same blog category<\/strong> &#8211; in this case, you should consider adding the user to an email sequence that sends them some of your most-read posts on that topic, invitations to download any relevant ebooks, and any case studies you might have from our real customer.<\/li>\n<li><strong>A user browses our product page 2+ times<\/strong> &#8211; here, you can add the user to a sequence where we share detailed product information or success stories from customers and an invitation to connect with your support for more help.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Pro tip<\/strong>: If you don\u2019t have a blog or use categories, you can take the same approach with the help of metrics like time spent on a page or pages viewed in a session.<\/p>\n<h3>Cart abandonment<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8946\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Cart-abandonment-.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"416\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Cart-abandonment-.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Cart-abandonment--300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Cart-abandonment--600x400.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Cart abandonment emails are a classic example of triggered email and should be considered essential for any eCommerce store.<\/p>\n<p>The <u><a href=\"https:\/\/sleeknote.com\/blog\/cart-abandonment-statistics\">average cart abandonment rate<\/a><\/u> across industries is around 70%. This means more than two-thirds of your customers leave the products they added to their cart and close the page before completing the checkout.<\/p>\n<p>You can reduce that cart abandonment rate substantially by setting up triggered emails so that when a user abandons their cart, they\u2019re automatically sent an email prompting them to complete their purchase.<\/p>\n<p>The most effective cart abandonment emails provide an incentive for the customer to complete the purchase, like a time-limited discount or exclusive offer. You can also remind them what they\u2019re missing out on by including pictures and descriptions of the products they left in their cart.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to get the timing right for your cart abandonment emails. If you leave it too late, the customer might have already made the purchase elsewhere.<\/p>\n<h3>How to use this:<\/h3>\n<p>A good place to start is by following the advice of CRO experts <u><a href=\"https:\/\/convertica.org\/cart-conversion\/\">Convertica<\/a><\/u> and use a 3 email sequence for cart abandonments.\u00a0 The first is sent 1hr after abandonment, the 2nd a day after, and the 3rd is sent 3 days after.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pro tip<\/strong>: if you\u2019re offering coupons in these abandonment emails, you can \u2018jump the queue\u2019 by deploying an exit-intent popup that offers the same.\u00a0 Make sure to test the emails against the popup and stick with what works best!<\/p>\n<h3>Welcome back<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8953\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/welcome-back.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/welcome-back.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/welcome-back-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/welcome-back-600x399.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Another popular type of triggered email is the welcome back email.<\/p>\n<p>You can set up your campaign so that when a user visits the site after a prolonged hiatus, it automatically sends them a \u2018welcome back\u2019 email to bring them up to speed on new content, products, sales, etc.<\/p>\n<p>The trick with this one is not to be too specific with your messaging &#8211; not everyone is crazy about (or understands) being tracked on the internet so make sure to avoid subject lines like \u201cWelcome back, Quincy &#8211; we haven\u2019t seen you in 43 days!\u201d.<\/p>\n<h3>How to use this:<\/h3>\n<p>Start by splitting returning uses into 2 categories: customers and non-customers.\u00a0 If they are a customer we don\u2019t send anything at this time and instead defer them to the aforementioned \u201cPage or blog category deep dive\u201d sequence to see how we might serve them better.<\/p>\n<p>Non-customers get a basic \u201cHere\u2019s what you missed\u201d email with new content, product updates, and a unique coupon to encourage conversions.<\/p>\n<h3>Lead conversion<\/h3>\n<p>Anyone who opts in or signs up for something on your site should always get an automated email.<\/p>\n<p>Full stop.<\/p>\n<p>Other than post-purchase, this is the best chance you have at getting a user to open an email so it\u2019s important to send something quickly.<\/p>\n<h3>How to use this<\/h3>\n<p>The approach to using this is simple &#8211; you can use various ebooks and digital downloads on your site that add users to relevant email sequences.\u00a0 The download is emailed immediately after conversion and the remaining emails begin the next day (a good goal is to send between 3-5 emails in as many days).<\/p>\n<h2>Where to start with trigger emails<\/h2>\n<p>If your company already relies on email marketing then it\u2019s likely you already know how to set up and organize most of these campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>However, if you\u2019re just getting your feet wet in the email marketing pool, we have a few tips on how to get up and running with your first campaign.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8955 \" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Where-to-start-with-trigger-emails.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"516\" height=\"516\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Where-to-start-with-trigger-emails.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Where-to-start-with-trigger-emails-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Where-to-start-with-trigger-emails-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Where-to-start-with-trigger-emails-600x600.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Sign up for an email marketing platform<\/h3>\n<p>The first thing you\u2019ll need is an email marketing platform.
