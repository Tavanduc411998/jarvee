					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s indeed very tempting to buy fake followers and engagement when you&#039;re just starting. I did it on my account because I wanted to appear more influential, but I learned that doing that did more harm than good. In the end I had to let go of my account, and create a completely new account because I got constantly issues like shadowban, and felt like Instagram punished my account.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Talking about social proofs, I recall observing a youtube channel that used to have millions of views ( fake ) and used to show up on the trending pages of youtube. The content was that great at all and the only real views were in the thousands ( I concluded that by observing other videos and social profiles of theirs). However, they turned it up a notch in content and now even the REAL views they get are around in the millions.
Social proof really is key.]]></description>
