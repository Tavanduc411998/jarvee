					<description><![CDATA[As all things in life so the social media has two sides of one coin, good and bad. I prefer to talk about bad things because that&#039;s the way how to improve things. W all use social media, but we must be responsible and we must have our limits.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice one Joy,

Congratulations! I like how you think.

It&#039;s important for younger people to have parent control when they start using it. Then they will be familiar with it&#039;s pros and cons. This was harder for Milenials because their parents were not that familiar with all the things that social media can bring, bad and good. Now for the Generation Z this shouldn&#039;t be the case because their parents are now more included in the digital world and we all talk openly about our good and bad experiences.

Thanks for sharing!]]></description>
