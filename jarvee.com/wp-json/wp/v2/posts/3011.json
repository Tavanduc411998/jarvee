Be sure what you want to convey, have it consistent with your identity to help build your credibility and trust with your target audience. After you have done this, deliver your message in a very intriguing way. It catches the attention of the people, and more so when it is shared on other online social platforms.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use SlideShow presentations to explain relevant information related to your niche. It empowers your audience to know more about the nature of what you are doing and why you are doing it. Also, cater to the emotions of the people, evoking strong feelings which inspire them to proactively act upon what you want them to do after watching the presentation.<\/p>\n<h3>Keep It Simple<\/h3>\n<p>Make sure you use SlideShare presentations to communicate a focused and strong message. An average presentation is composed of 14 slides, and fewer than 25 words per slide. This avoids the person viewing from being overwhelmed with your content. Thus, this helps you keep the attention of your audience as they go through your presentation.<\/p>\n<h3>Get Detailed<\/h3>\n<p>There are other sources which also suggest that when you use SlideShare presentations to communicate a message, longer sideshows perform better compared with shorter presentations. Social Media Scientist Dan Zarrella <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/blog\/tabid\/6307\/bid\/6376\/Data-Shows-Presentations-With-More-Slides-Get-Viewed-More-on-SlideShare.aspx\">reported<\/a> in 2010 that presentations with more than 60 slides or longer generate the most views. One can speculate that this may be the case because of the high number of professionals who are using this site. They would like in-depth information and detailed data.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to approach this is to test both long and concise presentations and see which generate more traffic for your business. <\/p>\n<h3>Think of the Title Slides as Video Thumbnails<\/h3>\n<p>Use SlideShow presentations, especially the title slides, as video thumbnails. The title slides must be captivating by incorporating bold colors, an interesting title, and creative design. This is the first thing that people see, so optimize this opportunity to gather clicks. Back this up with amazing content and your slides will garner popularity.<\/p>\n<h3>Make Your Title and Description Interesting<\/h3>\n<p>Use SlideShare presentation titles and descriptions as your primary opportunities for impact. Make your title memorable and informative to make it attractive. Couple that with an interesting description to make the online user learn about your presentation. Have your keywords in the title and description to achieve maximum SEO effect.<\/p>\n<h3>Include Long Tail Keywords<\/h3>\n<p>Put long tail keywords to use SlideShare presentations to get more traffic. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/\">SlideShare<\/a> is a high ranking website, and great for long tail keywords. Include these type of keywords in the description, and even in the title. This is very useful in your Google ranking, so think of a clever long tail keyword that associates with your presentation and brand.<\/p>\n<h3>Include Links in Key Places<\/h3>\n<p>There are key places that you should be placing your links to use SlideShare presentations to get more traffic. Include the link in your profile so people can easily see your affiliations online. Strategically place a link within your SlideShare presentation. Have your link also in the beginning and at the end of your presentation to ensure enough remembrance to your viewers without overwhelming them.<\/p>\n<h3>Create a Consistent Color Palette<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/color-palette.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3643\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/color-palette.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/color-palette-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/color-palette-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/color-palette-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><br \/>\nBe conscious of the colors you use in SlideShare presentations. Graphic designers suggest that you stick to one to two colors throughout your presentation. You can get cues from your logo or main image to make it consistent. You can use online design tools like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pictaculous.com\/\">Pictaculous<\/a> to get a full-color palette based on your uploaded image.<\/p>\n<h3>Utilize Amazing Images<\/h3>\n<p>When you use SlideShare presentations, visual content is vital in delivering your message. Incorporate amazing images to make your slides more attractive. Depending on your presentation, you may need just one image or a hundred. You can upload images you have taken yourself, or <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/best-places-get-free-images-content\/\">get free images readily searchable online<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The images that you use in SlideShare presentations should be of the best quality as possible. You wouldn\u2019t want your audience to get irritated with the images you use instead of focusing on your message. Also, take note of the lighting, angles, and other elements in the images. Make sure that all of these are consistent with the message that you would want to come across.<\/p>\n<h3>Make Use of Creative Fonts<\/h3>\n<p>If you want to get more traffic from your SlideShare presentations, utilize alternative fonts from ones standardly used. You may commonly use Times New Roman and Arial, but you can use Baskerville and Open Sans instead. If you can\u2019t find a suitable option for your presentations, you can access <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fontsquirrel.com\/\">Font Squirrel<\/a> for your free font source.<\/p>\n<h3>Teasers for Full Content<\/h3>\n<p>Use SlideShare presentations previews and teasers as leverage for more content. A sampling of your blog and website can be the content of your presentation. Some even present samples of publications that they made, and inviting the audience for the full version when they click on a link at the end of the presentation or in the definition.<\/p>\n<p>When you use SlideShare presentations this way, the high-quality content that you made will enable the audience to trust you with their information. They will be confident enough to complete forms that you make them register for full content access. Make sure that the call-to-action that you place in the presentation is clickable. This is important for lead generation especially when your presentation gets embedded on another site.<\/p>\n<h3>Shared Promotion<\/h3>\n<p>Getting in touch with experts, influentials, and professionals in your industry is a way to use SlideShare presentations to get more traffic. This is a win-win situation for both parties. The person you communicate with will get mileage from a new audience, which is your own audience. You will also most likely garner a promotion from them, and this is important to make you more popular in the industry.<\/p>\n<p>Frederik Vincx used SlideShare presentations in this manner\u00a0and was able to successfully get more traffic. He got in touch with a marketing guru Brian Solis one time and quoted them in his deck. He was able to get a positive response from Solis through Tweet quoting Vincx, and an inclusion in the guru\u2019s website.<\/p>\n<h3>News-jacking<\/h3>\n<p>Use SlideShare presentations to link the content of your presentations with the relevant and recent news. Your content easily gets picked up\u00a0by major media networks. This also helps you to be part of searches which trend in your time of posting. You get noticed not only by the SlideShare team but also other related websites, blogs, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Emiland De Cubber used SlideShare presentations this way. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/EmilandDC\/dear-nsa-let-me-take-care-ou\">overhauled NSA decks<\/a> when the agency was trending. He got the attention of media outlets because of this.<\/p>\n<h3>Upload Quality Presentations<\/h3>\n<p>Upload presentations of the best quality to get more traffic. If you find it difficult to come up with one, it may be wise to look for one who can or even pay for their service. Remember that to make your presentations of great quality, both content, and the design should be considered.<\/p>\n<p>The format of the presentations is also important when you use SlideShare presentations for traffic acquisition as well. Save your presentation as a PDF rather than a PPS. You can be assured that a PDF will look the same across devices, unlike PPS.<\/p>\n<h3>Cross-channel Marketing<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/cross-promotion-social-media.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"531\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3644\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/cross-promotion-social-media.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/cross-promotion-social-media-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/cross-promotion-social-media-768x510.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/cross-promotion-social-media-600x398.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><br \/>\nUse SlideShare presentations in combination with your existing social media accounts and blog or website.
