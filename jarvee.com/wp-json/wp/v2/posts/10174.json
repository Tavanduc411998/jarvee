Most webmasters don\u2019t even bother with it, and this is evident as <u><a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/search-traffic-study\/\">up to two-thirds of all web pages<\/a><\/u> on the internet have zero backlinks.<\/p>\n<p>If this sounds like you, we have bad news for you. You need to build links (and sometimes loads of them) to succeed in the highly competitive organic search traffic space. The good news though is that this process doesn\u2019t always have to be hard \u2013 if you know a few tricks.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, we go over seven of the most efficient link building tactics that we\u2019ve used to land ourselves hundreds of quality backlinks without breaking the bank. If you can perfect on 2-3 of these strategies, there\u2019s no way you won\u2019t crush your SEO results in 2022.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s dive in!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Gather industry statistics<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10177\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Gather-industry-statistics.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Gather-industry-statistics.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Gather-industry-statistics-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Gather-industry-statistics-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Website owners are always looking for relevant industry stats to back their data-driven content. If you can create pages with well-researched and accurate statistics that others in your niche are interested in, you should easily attract backlinks to your website.<\/p>\n<p>Do you need to conduct research to gather this data? Absolutely not. You can just cite secondary sources and create a hub of links that both content creators and searchers will find useful. The goal is to help them save on research time; which some will pay back by linking to your page. Win-win situation!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Repurpose and syndicate your best-performing content<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Say you have a blog post that keeps bringing in hundreds of visitors every day. What this means is that the content inside it is in demand and users are finding it helpful.<\/p>\n<p>With this in mind, you can recreate it in other formats to fit different audiences and channels and potentially get it in front of even more eyeballs. For example, you can repurpose a blog post to create an infographic or a video.<\/p>\n<p>Syndication entails third-party websites that pick up content from other websites, usually, images and infographics, write a short excerpt of your content, and acknowledge the source by linking back to it.<\/p>\n<h3>Reclaim lost links<\/h3>\n<p>Picture this; you\u2019ve worked hard enough and built tens or even hundreds of backlinks to your site. Then a few months down the line, you notice that number has gone down. Don\u2019t fret just yet.<\/p>\n<p>Losing backlinks is something you should always be ready for and this is why. Webmasters are constantly revamping their websites, changing URL structure, redoing content, and sometimes even deleting non-performing pages. If any of these happens, a page with your link could be affected and your link lost.<\/p>\n<p>More often than not, you only need to reach out to the owner to try and see if they can reinstate the lost link. Remember to be courteous while making your request and where possible, offer a small favor in return.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Claim unlinked mentions<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This mainly applies to already popular websites which are engaging massively on social media, creating top industry content that trends or those using PR campaigns. Chances are that your website will get mentioned, sometimes without the mentioning website linking to yours.<\/p>\n<p>This presents an excellent opportunity to build links using the simple strategy we\u2019re about to share with you.<\/p>\n<p>First, create a system that <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/unlinked-mentions\/\">monitors any unbranded mentions on the internet<\/a>. You can implement tools such as Google Alerts, IFTTT or Mention to automate the process.<\/p>\n<p>You should then reach out to anyone who\u2019s mentioning your website or brand and request them to add a link to your site if they haven\u2019t already.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Comment more on blogs<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Blog commenting as an SEO strategy keeps getting a bad rap, but is it that useless? We don\u2019t think so. In fact, blog comments are one of our favorite link building strategies and we don\u2019t see this changing any time soon.<\/p>\n<p>To <a href=\"https:\/\/smartblogger.com\/blog-comments\/\">stand out from the crowd<\/a> (read spammers) and get your comments accepted by the site owner, you need to lead with value. Write well-thought-out comments that complement the content of the original post. We\u2019ve found 100-150-word responses to work best for comments; they\u2019re not too long yet give you enough space to put your point across.<\/p>\n<p>While at it, drop a link to a relevant piece of content on your website that offers more insights into what you said in your response.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Reach out to local bloggers for local SEO<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10179\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Reach-out-to-local-bloggers-for-local-SEO.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"387\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Reach-out-to-local-bloggers-for-local-SEO.png 765w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Reach-out-to-local-bloggers-for-local-SEO-300x193.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Reach-out-to-local-bloggers-for-local-SEO-600x387.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to rank your local business on top of search engine results, here\u2019s a simple strategy you should use more in 2022.<\/p>\n<p>Start by identifying local bloggers whose websites appear active or attract some traffic. You\u2019ll find that most cover viral niches such as fashion, food, travel, and tech to name a few. Also, don\u2019t forget to <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/best-ways-connect-influencers-social-media\/\">check popular social media channels<\/a> such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook to discover potential opportunities that aren\u2019t necessarily indexed in Google.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have a list ready, try to find if there\u2019s a connection between their site and yours. Steer clear of spammy sites and those that are hardly updated.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, reach out, pitch them a piece of content with a link to your website in it. Alternatively, offer them an incentive \u2013 money works magic \u2013 to add a link to one of their existing or fresh content pieces.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Pursue high-quality guest posting opportunities<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>A lot of SEO experts want you to believe that guest posting is dead, but nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, some of the most powerful backlinks we\u2019ve acquired for our business have been through this old-age building tactic.<\/p>\n<p>The trick lies in understanding how to unearth relevant and high-quality prospects that are not link farms or blatantly selling links. Our rule of thumb is to avoid websites with \u201cwrite for us\u201d type of pages \u2013unless we determine that they have strict editorial guidelines to discourage the masses.<\/p>\n<p>Besides, we prioritize websites that fall in our niche or related verticals for higher link relevance in the eyes of Google.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10181\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/link-building-tactics.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/link-building-tactics.png 453w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/link-building-tactics-300x199.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Link building has changed rapidly in the past few years, with more focus now being on quality and relevance than on quantity.
