After all, each organization\u2019s goal is to increase its sales\u2014the more eyeballs and hype, the better the sales potential.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content is the crucial ingredient that makes the recipe light up. While most would go for content marketing, some are attracted to influencer marketing, a somewhat newer player in town.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Content Marketing?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/9-emerging-content-marketing-trends-in-2021\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content marketing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a marketing approach that focuses on creating and distributing relevant, meaningful, and consistent content to attract and maintain your audience. The goal is to motivate profitable customer action.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, instead of doing a traditional sales-push method for your sales pitch, you are providing the audience with relevant and useful content to help solve their issues.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Can Content Marketing Help You?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One fact that every marketer knows &#8211; content is the present and future of marketing. But, how is it that even though you keep throwing tons of information at your potential clients, you still fail? Chances are, you\u2019re one of many in the same situation where all you\u2019re doing is throwing informational garbage that\u2019s not valuable or relevant to them.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where content marketing comes into the picture, as this strategy is all about having effective and relevant content, something that speaks to your audience and piques their interests.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>If done right, content marketing can:<\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attract Committed and Loyal Clients<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content is an effective medium to answer any queries about your products\/services and address your clients\u2019 needs. When you craft credible, meaningful, and authoritative content that helps solve problems or educate a particular niche in a field, people will likely trust you and come back for more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Informative and engaging content can help build meaningful relationships with your clients. From here, they can quickly turn into loyal advocates of your brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Build a Strong and Credible Brand<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quality content speaks volumes, and this helps to boost the company\u2019s brand reputation as it shows that you know what you\u2019re talking about and places you in a leading position. Having customers vouch for you with a testimonial is one of the best tactics for encouraging potential buyers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is because consumers would like to know about your products\/services before deciding to invest in them. Showcasing good, reliable, and trustworthy reviews can also help build credibility for your brand.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reduce Marketing Costs<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In general, content marketing is relatively inexpensive, and it brings many benefits to companies. Although it does cost you time and effort, you\u2019ll find that the sooner you do so, the faster you\u2019ll see the results you want. It will be worth your investment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boost SEO\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having quality content and following <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/5-types-of-link-magnets-that-can-skyrocket-your-seo\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO best practices<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can help increase your traffic volume. The better your content is, the more likely you will be able to attract a larger audience. Users can easily find your content when they search, and since you\u2019ve posted relevant information, they\u2019ll keep coming back for more.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The Cons of Using Content Marketing<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you solely bank all your marketing efforts on content alone, there are some cautions to note:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Harder to Implement<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More and more entry barriers make it harder to insert your brand\u2019s content into external platforms. As such, more marketers are finding it difficult to be successful in strategies such as off-site SEO.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Could be Costly &amp; Take Time<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although I mentioned above that content marketing is generally inexpensive, there are times that it can be costly. Content relies much on its authenticity. If you\u2019re going to write about something, you have to make sure it\u2019s authentic and accurate; ingredients for quality content.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are unfamiliar with a particular niche, you need more time to research or consider engaging expert content producers specializing in the niche. The latter could cost you more, but potentially reduce cost and improve your credibility in the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensure Consistency<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As time goes by, there\u2019s this tendency for marketers to focus on only wanting to get the content out there; anything will do. Then it becomes the continuous publishing of neverending content streams with no consistency. Many make this common mistake. Bear in mind that it\u2019s not only the content delivery that matters but also the overall quality.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, note that delivering content at the right time also makes a difference, so make sure you keep track of the data that fits your audience demographics.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Influencer Marketing?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concept of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/what-you-need-to-know-about-influencer-marketing-and-its-role-in-e-commerce-business\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">influencer marketing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> leverages the reach of an existing influencer who has already built a large following and a strong reputation in a particular niche. This helps support your brand and endorse your product\/services to increase your brand awareness and drive sales.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9149\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-9149\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-9149\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/InfluencerMarketingGrowth-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"344\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/InfluencerMarketingGrowth-1.jpg 750w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/InfluencerMarketingGrowth-1-300x159.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/InfluencerMarketingGrowth-1-600x318.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-9149\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/influencermarketinghub.com\/influencer-marketing-benchmark-report-2021\/\">Influencer Marketing Expected to Grow to be Worth $13.8 Billion in 2021\u00a0<\/a><\/p><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite initial concerns that influencer marketing may take a nosedive due to Covid-19, it has increased in reality. After all, people now spend considerably more time online than previously, so in a way, Covid-19 helped accelerate influencer marketing growth in 2020, and this is estimated to continue in 2021.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a known fact that customers would trust recommendations from a third party rather than you as the brand itself. As such, influencers can be a third party that will help spread the word about your product or service. Of course, you\u2019ll need to identify your target audience to better define your influencers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In short, your brand needs to be communicated and promoted by the right personality who is familiar with your industry, has the right authority surrounding your brand, and then builds the right content among your community.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Influencer marketing needs to be dynamic and, if done right can:<\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increase Awareness in Your Brand<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Influencers have a high proportion of engagement since most have ardent followers. They can do this without the need to use sales or advertising pitches in such interactions overly. The goal is more of striking a friendly conversation, not just focusing on conversions alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Influencers already have a strong backing of followers, to begin with. They trust the suggestions and viewpoint of the influencer, so whatever the influencer shares, chances are, it will be good, and they\u2019ll trust as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can leverage this and increase your brand\u2019s authority by boosting its perception when the influencers\u2019 followers engage with your branded influencer\u2019s content.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key to making successful influencer marketing is collaborating with the relevant and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/eduardklein.com\/how-to-become-an-influencer\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">right influencers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Basically, people who are having the same niche as yours, having a group of real followers, and posting genuine content.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increase Brand Reach<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can capture new markets, which you may find difficult to tap into in the first place. Did you know that most people look for reviews and recommendations before they decide to purchase? Social channels are often their go-to resources.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember to put extra consideration into your engagement with each influencer since they often have varying characteristics. By doing so, the chances of your brand gaining greater exposure will increase.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solidifies Customers\u2019 Trust<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An influencer can produce entrancing content that surrounds your brand or product if he\/she trusts your brand or product. As such, their followers, upon coming across this content, would likely believe it and, therefore, your brand as well.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To do so, you\u2019ll need to convince the influencers that your service\/product is worth promoting on social media. Invite them to experience your product\/service personally. Of course, you\u2019ll need to explain what constitutes your unique selling proposition or value proposition.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever that the influencers say becomes authentic and genuine reviews as they have personally tried them out. Influencers sell experiences, and since these are real and authentic, customers can relate to them quickly and trust their recommendations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Influencers Know Their Audience<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since influencers dedicate their time to posting and chatting with their audiences, they would have formed a \u2018personal relationship with them. Therefore they can maneuver and catch the attention of their niche faster and easier. Additionally, influencers understand the market better. As such, they could help you structure your general strategy and the content too.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Increases Search Potential<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Influencers have a high Domain Authority (DA). Moving to engage key influencers is useful, especially when they link and mention you in their social media content. Many influencers will be able to pass on a good quantity of link power, helping you to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.singlegrain.com\/social-media-management\/best-practices\/how-to-increase-website-traffic-through-social-media\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">get traffic<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and quality backlinks that can help with your SEO effort.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Boosts Return of Investment (ROI)<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9148\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/InfluencerMarketingROI.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"348\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/InfluencerMarketingROI.jpg 750w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/InfluencerMarketingROI-300x160.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/InfluencerMarketingROI-600x321.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">67% of the respondents measure the ROI from their influencer campaigns (Source: Influencer Marketing Hub)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many believe that they can improve their earnings manifold via leveraging influencer marketing. That is why around 67% of companies measure their ROI from such campaigns. It really pays off.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The Cons of Using Influencer Marketing<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Influencer marketing isn\u2019t perfect though and there are areas you need to consider carefully. Some of these include;\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Stigma of Blind Loyalty\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although I did mention that followers trust their \u2018idols\u2019 and will \u2018follow\u2019 them implicitly, things have changed as most hold any product or service to higher scrutiny. So, this means that there is a fair segment that won\u2019t be affected by what can be perceived as blind loyalty.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The audience may measure your brand against the yardstick they have for the influencer. Therefore, you\u2019ll have your work cut out for you to ensure everything is done right and all relevant information gets across properly and accurately.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unrealistic Expectations in Engagement<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A massive number of followers can usually denote credibility and reliability, but this may not always be the case. There are many unpredictable forces in play as an influencer\u2019s popularity heavily depends on the many different expectations and characters of these followers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, it is pertinent to drive meaningful engagement and build relationships tactfully and continuously with followers to ensure loyalty.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Higher Costs Involved<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Engaging an influencer is not cheap. This is confirmed by businesses that have jumped on the influencer marketing trend. Many have spent billions of dollars on just the Instagram platform. So, you may want to look at cheaper options. There is an even larger pool of influences with smaller audiences that can be interesting to consider.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content Marketing vs. Influencer Marketing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though they\u2019re different, as you can see above, their goals remain essentially the same. Both are viable strategies and can complement one another. It doesn\u2019t have to be one strategy or the other, as influencer marketing can be a solid addition to your overall content strategy if done right.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, it\u2019s not so much of pitting content against influencer marketing; it is more of how they can work together and complement one another to create that needed ripple effect, enhancing your brand awareness, reach, and visibility, which in turn, can boost sales, leads generation, trust, and credibility.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which is For You?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are close to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.scalahosting.com\/blog\/2021-vps-hosting-statistics\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.9 billion internet users<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> globally, which is more than 60% of the global population. This is, no doubt, a huge market you can tap into. Many have registered great success by building a foundation of content first and then amplify it with influencer marketing. In short, influencer marketing complements content marketing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content should always be your baseline. Once you\u2019ve created that solid content base, influencers can help generate quick and solid wins. Whatever it is, influencer marketing needs content to thrive. If you don\u2019t have the right content, how can an influencer successfully promote your brand, products, or services?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting the right persona that fits your brand is the start of a successful campaign. Next, keep your content up to date and maintain the right tone and messaging consistently. Being able to access influences of various levels on different platforms is important.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you can see, influencer marketing and content marketing are quite the same. They don&#8217;t differ much fundamentally. They go hand in hand. Good and quality content is the key to success in any <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/3-essential-marketing-strategies-to-adopt-after-covid-19\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">marketing initiative<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It takes a very holistic approach to drive effective branding and the voice of influencers does help. Influencers have a ready-made audience and can quickly boost your brand by several notches. Both powerful strategies and if used correctly can churn unbelievable results.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About the Author<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jason is the outreach manager and digital marketer from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.webrevenue.io\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WebRevenue.io<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a company that provides digital marketing for startups and online businesses.
