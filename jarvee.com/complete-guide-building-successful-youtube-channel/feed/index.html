					<description><![CDATA[Hi Adam! Great article! I have started my YouTube channel not too long ago and I&#039;m following some YouTube SEO tactics that help me grow the channel. Of course, video and content quality are very important. I&#039;m working on making sure that I&#039;m targeting the right keywords in my title and description. Also, optimizing the source file and the video length. All of these help make sure that my channel keeps growing in popularity and that I have an advantage over my competition. Thank you for sharing.]]></description>
