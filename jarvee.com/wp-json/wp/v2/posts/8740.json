Aside from being known as the best social media automation software, Jarvee also packed with lesser-known but absolutely useful functionalities, including the ability to download Instagram images and save them to your computer and more, truly a jack of all trades.<\/p>\n<p>2. Jarvee does not limit you only to downloading images from Instagram, it also enables you to grab videos and albums.<\/p>\n<p>3. In addition to grabbing photos, videos, and albums from Instagram, Jarvee also allows you to grab the posts together with its original caption, tagged users, hashtags, mentioned users, and more.<\/p>\n<p>4.You can also use the downloaded image or videos for <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/cross-promoting-social-media-jarvee\/\">cross-posting to other compatible social media platforms<\/a> you are managing in Jarvee.<\/p>\n<h3>How To Download Images from Instagram Using Jarvee<\/h3>\n<p>To grab your favorite Instagram images via Jarvee, you will need to do the following steps:<\/p>\n<p>1. <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/knowledge-base\/add-instagram-account-jarvee\/\">Add an Instagram account<\/a> (if you have not done it yet) to Social Profiles in Jarvee, and make sure it shows a Valid status. Then access the Tools and navigate to Repost Tool.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8744\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/adding-social-profiles.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"362\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/adding-social-profiles.png 1294w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/adding-social-profiles-300x167.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/adding-social-profiles-1024x571.png 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/adding-social-profiles-768x428.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/adding-social-profiles-600x334.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>2. From the <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/knowledge-base\/instagram-repost-tool\/\">Repost Tool<\/a>, you\u2019ll find three sub-tabs \u2013 Settings, Sources, and Results. But before we proceed with grabbing the images, we need to <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/knowledge-base\/campaigns-overview\/\">create a Campaign<\/a> first where we will send the images to.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8747\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/creating-a-campaign.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"412\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/creating-a-campaign.png 1101w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/creating-a-campaign-300x190.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/creating-a-campaign-1024x649.png 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/creating-a-campaign-768x487.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/creating-a-campaign-600x380.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>3. Next, you will need to have your sources ready. So to get an idea of what you need to gather, you can click on the Sources tab and you will see all the available sources that you can use.<\/p>\n<p>Now, if you already have a specific Instagrammer in mind, then you can enable the \u2018Repost Posts of Specific Users\u2019 and add the usernames inside the box provided then click the \u2018Add Usernames\u2019 button.\u00a0 \u00a0You can do the same with all the other sources you want to use, just enable and add the required information in the designated boxes.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, since I am a foodie, I\u2019ve been following a specific account on that niche thus shown in the image below.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8743\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Add-Sources.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Add-Sources.png 1442w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Add-Sources-300x185.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Add-Sources-1024x630.png 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Add-Sources-768x472.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Add-Sources-600x369.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>4. Once you are done with adding your sources, head to the Repost Settings tab, set your preferred settings (number of posts you want to repost, etc.), and filter.<\/p>\n<p>You can choose to repost only images, videos, images or videos, albums,s or all of them.\u00a0 Additionally, you can enable other filters or settings but this is mostly done for advanced usage and in our case, we only want to download Instagram images, so I suggest not enabling any of them.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8749\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Repost-Post-Filters.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"336\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Repost-Post-Filters.png 1296w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Repost-Post-Filters-300x155.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Repost-Post-Filters-1024x529.png 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Repost-Post-Filters-768x397.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Repost-Post-Filters-600x310.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>5. Still, on the Repost Settings tab, scroll down to the Repost Settings option and you\u2019ll find the option \u2018Send posts to campaign instead of posting on the wall\u2019, enable this option and select the campaign you created in Step 2 from the drop-down option. You may or may not tick the option \u2018Send posts to Drafts\u2019, it will not affect the process, so it\u2019s all up to you.\u00a0 When all is set, just click the \u2018Send To Campaign Now\u2019 button.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8750\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Repost-Settings.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"496\" height=\"565\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Repost-Settings.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Repost-Settings-263x300.png 263w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Repost-Settings-600x684.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>How To Save Downloaded Images To Your Computer<\/h3>\n<p>Go to the Campaign you created earlier and navigate to the Posts List tab, you should see the posts that it received from the Repost tool.
