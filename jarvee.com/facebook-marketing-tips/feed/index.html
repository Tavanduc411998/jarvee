					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve seen a lot of the clever and big marketing agencies now properly utilize the power of chatbots! 

It&#039;s such a nice way of marketing and as soon as I started to use them, I saw a very high increase in the % of opt-ins for my lead magnet. People should really jump on this train before it gets saturated and expensive.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m both happy and sad that you guys mentioned facebook pages to watch since not many people are currently utilizing its full power!

Happy because people will benefit from it. Sad because of the same reason lol, I&#039;ll have more competition.

I have been spying and curating content from Facebook pages to watch for a while and it always drives great engagement. every single time literally!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Facebook has made a very clever move with Facebook pages to watch. It increases the percentage of quality content produced since competitors will have more quality material to curate content with. 

The result? Both Facebook and the brand benefit. it&#039;s a win-win situation for everyone!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I myself reshare old top performing content several times. However, I&#039;d really advise to only re-share 3-5 times max. That too with 3-5 weeks intervals in between.

Aside from saving time on writing good content, you also increase the probability of sharing your content to the people who didn&#039;t get the chance to see it!]]></description>
