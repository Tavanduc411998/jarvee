					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing these insights! What I noticed on my personal account is that there are some awesome accounts that I don&#039;t see on my feed anymore. I realized that I wasn&#039;t liking posts from these pages and that&#039;s why Instagram wasn&#039;t showing them. As soon as I liked some of their posts they started to show on my feed again. This logic makes sense, hence you have to like and appreciate posts that you want to see more often.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m wondering if they will really remove the number of likes per post, I heard they did some testing within users, but I&#039;m still able to see the number of likes.]]></description>
