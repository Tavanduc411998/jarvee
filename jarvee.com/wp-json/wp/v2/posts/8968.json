When you have a question or are looking for something online, you type your question or describe what you want to find into a search field.<\/p>\n<p>Google then answers you by returning websites it deems relevant to your search. But how does Google know what to show you and in what order?<\/p>\n<p>It needs to know that your website is there, what it is about, and its popularity. That is what optimizing your website for SEO will do for you.<\/p>\n<p>SEO does not happen overnight and takes time. Additionally, there are no shortcuts, and optimizing for SEO is not a finite process.<\/p>\n<p>You will need to constantly tweak your website to stay in the game because search engines change their algorithms often, and competition is fierce.<\/p>\n<p>Google and other search engines use crawlers to search for web pages. They find them by following links and analyzing XML sitemaps.<\/p>\n<p>What should you do to make your website search engine friendly? Below are several of the critical website elements for optimizing websites:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use an internal linking strategy that makes it easy for search engines to find your most popular pages.<\/li>\n<li>Include an XML sitemap formatted to tell Google which pages they can search.<\/li>\n<li>Choose a URL structure and use it consistently.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure your website is mobile-friendly.<\/li>\n<li>Keep URLs short, relevant to the page contents, and easy for search engines and humans to read.<\/li>\n<li>Avoid duplicate content.<\/li>\n<li>Be sure that your web pages load quickly for optimal user experience.<\/li>\n<li>Avoid using too many ads or popups on your site. They are intrusive to the user experience and may result in lower search engine rankings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To gain insights into how Google sees your website, add it to <u><a href=\"https:\/\/search.google.com\/search-console\/welcome\">Google Search Console<\/a><\/u>. Analyze the data and reports to see the search terms people are using to find your site, how your pages look in search results, and how often they are clicked.<\/p>\n<p>This way, you will know what is working and what is not, and you can make changes where necessary to improve your website\u2019s performance.<\/p>\n<h3>3.\u00a0\u00a0 Add Your Website to Online Directories and Social Media Sites<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8971\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Add-Your-Website-to-Online-Directories-and-Social-Media-Sites.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"289\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Add-Your-Website-to-Online-Directories-and-Social-Media-Sites.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Add-Your-Website-to-Online-Directories-and-Social-Media-Sites-300x139.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/Add-Your-Website-to-Online-Directories-and-Social-Media-Sites-600x278.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Google is not the only place to list your website.
