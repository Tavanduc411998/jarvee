You need to choose a topic that really interests you and that you want to learn more about or you will battle to write consistently.<\/p>\n<p>You also need to have an audience for what you write so you need to find out whether enough other people are interested in the topic. It is better for readers and search engines if you focus on a specific niche instead of making your blog too general.<\/p>\n<h3>#2 Name your blog and find a web host<\/h3>\n<p>Finding a domain name for your blog is exciting. When coming up with a name, think about using a keyword that represents what it is about. It helps to make it catchy and memorable and using a .com is best.<\/p>\n<p>There are many companies that offer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.guru99.com\/best-registrars-how-to-buy-domain-name.html\">domain names<\/a> and it doesn\u2019t cost much to buy one. Web hosting allows your blog to be seen online and many web hosting companies offer to host at reasonable prices.<\/p>\n<h3>#3 Install WordPress<\/h3>\n<p>WordPress is one of the best free blogging platforms and it is easy to install. With a few clicks, it is ready to start using.<\/p>\n<p>If you are new to WordPress, you may be a little daunted when you log in and see the dashboard but it won\u2019t take long before you\u2019re comfortable using it. There are many tutorials you can find online to help you get started and plenty of support for this blogging platform.<\/p>\n<h3>#4 Choose a theme<\/h3>\n<p>WordPress free themes make it easy to get started, even if you don\u2019t have design skills. First, you need to login to your WordPress admin by going to yourdomain.com\/wp-admin and entering your user credentials.<\/p>\n<p>Go to \u201cAppearance\u201d in the sidebar on the left of your dashboard, hover over it and then click on \u201cThemes.\u201d When you click \u201cAdd New,\u201d you will see thousands of themes. Clicking on the thumbnail of a theme offers you a preview of what the theme will look like. If it suits your topic and personal style, you can go ahead and click \u201cinstall,\u201d activate it and start customizing.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7599\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/blog-posting-optimization.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"820\" height=\"547\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/blog-posting-optimization.jpg 820w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/blog-posting-optimization-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/blog-posting-optimization-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/blog-posting-optimization-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>#5 Optimize technical blog aspects<\/h3>\n<p>Various <a href=\"https:\/\/themegrill.com\/blog\/best-wordpress-blog-plugins\/\">WordPress plugins<\/a> help you to optimize the technical aspects of your blog. For example, it helps if your XML sitemap is automatically updated because it allows the search engines to crawl your blog for your new posts or pages.<\/p>\n<p>You can also optimize your Permalinks, which are the static hyperlinks leading to a particular post. In the left sidebar, hover over \u201cSettings\u201d and choose \u201cPermalinks\u201d to create a custom URL structure that looks better than the WordPress default.<\/p>\n<p><span data-identifyelement=\"355\">If you\u2019re daunted by these technical aspects, you can check out any\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dripmarketing.co\/blog\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-identifyelement=\"356\"><span data-identifyelement=\"357\">advanced marketing blog<\/span><\/a><span data-identifyelement=\"358\">\u00a0or other similar sites for help.<\/span><span dir=\"ltr\" data-identifyelement=\"359\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>#6 Choose engaging blog topics<\/h3>\n<p>There are many different ways to come up with blog topics. It can help to start by writing down questions your audience may be asking. If you type your question into Quora, you will soon see how many people are asking and answering questions about the topic.<\/p>\n<p>Think about what will excite or inspire your audience. For example, if they are camping enthusiasts, they may be excited about a new kind of tent. Figure out what common challenges your audience may be facing. For example, said camping enthusiasts may have problems with camping gear that\u2019s too heavy.<\/p>\n<h3>#7 Publish your first blog post<\/h3>\n<p>Intimate knowledge of who you\u2019re writing for will help you to write engaging content. All you need to do to create your blog post is to go to \u201cPosts\u201d in the left sidebar of the dashboard and click \u201cAdd New.\u201d You will see various editing options and you can click \u201cToolbar Toggle\u201d to see more.<\/p>\n<p>Add a keyword-optimized title as well as subheadings and bullet points to break up your text and make it easier to read. Add images to your post by clicking the \u201cAdd Media\u201d button, which allows you to drag and drop images into your post.<\/p>\n<p>Before you publish your post, click on \u201cPreview\u201d so you can see what it will look like and make any changes you think are necessary, including fixing any grammar and spelling mistakes.<\/p>\n<h3>#8 Share your post on social media<\/h3>\n<p>You won\u2019t get anywhere if you create a blog and you don\u2019t market it. Make sure you share any content you publish to all your social media accounts. Choose a feature image that will entice users on social platforms to click on your post.<\/p>\n<p>When arriving on your blog, they may just stay there and browse other content. Start to learn what content works best on which platforms and which posts bring the most visitors to your blog.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7600\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/blog-post-scheduling.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"820\" height=\"615\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/blog-post-scheduling.jpg 820w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/blog-post-scheduling-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/blog-post-scheduling-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/blog-post-scheduling-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>#9 Create a schedule for your blog posts<\/h3>\n<p>Unless you <a href=\"https:\/\/neilpatel.com\/blog\/blogging-consistently\/\">publish content consistently<\/a>, you have little chance of building your audience. Having a schedule keeps you organized, accountable and helps you to streamline your marketing efforts.<\/p>\n<p>All you need to create a schedule is an Excel spreadsheet. Start with columns for the publishing date, title of the post, the keyword you want to target. The titles do not have to be perfect \u2013 they can simply be working headlines.<\/p>\n<h3>#10 Monetize your blog<\/h3>\n<p>With a blog, you can build an audience through many different mediums, such as using SEO strategies to get organic traffic from the search engines, publishing an email newsletter, building a presence on social media, reaching out to other bloggers and guest posting on their blogs.<\/p>\n<p>Your blog gives you an opportunity to interact with potential customers and get feedback from them. This can help you design products they really want and sell them. If your blog gets a high amount of traffic, you can sell ads to large corporations.<\/p>\n<p>Publishing great content also helps you to sell physical products. For example, you can become an Amazon affiliate by writing about products and directing people to Amazon through your links.<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>You may be disappointed that monetization comes last in this post. The reason for this is that making money the main driving factor in your early efforts can be counterproductive. As you consistently create great content, you will start building meaningful relationships. Your audience will help to point you in the right direction and this will enable you to sell the right products to them and be successful.<\/p>\n<h4>About the Author<\/h4>\n<p><b>Emma Coffinet<\/b> is a prolific academic writer known for high-class thesis, dissertation and essay writing.
