It simply means that when any of the businesses register a new field on Google, it will be crawled by Googlebot (Googlebot is Google&#8217;s smartphone). The indexation process will use the content; this content will be explored on mobile pages to quickly understand how it appears and functions in search results. If any of the websites are not optimized for mobile, then there are great chances that they will lose SEO visibility for the long-term.<\/p>\n<h3>Mobile Growth<\/h3>\n<p>Traffic due to mobile devices to websites has increased drastically over the last decade. Around 0.7% of web traffic was generated through mobile phones in 2009, whereas it reached 50.3% by 2017. This data shows that traffic from mobile devices is continuously increasing. And if your developed website does not answer all the needs of people exploring it on their mobile, then there are great chances that huge opportunities like improving their business sales and leads.<\/p>\n<h3>Using Apps for Exploring Options<\/h3>\n<p>As of the\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/276623\/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores\/\">third quarter of 2018<\/a><\/u>, more than one-third of the app was downloaded from the leading app store. It is estimated that this amount of app downloads was quite enough to drive around 66% of mobile app revenue worldwide for Apple&#8217;s platform. Many app development companies have worked hard to make an app for various fields; this has made the apple app store a lucrative one in today&#8217;s app market. This trend highlights how important it is to have an <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/6-mobile-app-marketing-strategies-that-work-wonders-for-any-app\/\">app download option on your business website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Develop Business Website<\/h3>\n<p>You will be shocked to know that there are about\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/news.netcraft.com\/archives\/2018\/01\/19\/january-2018-web-server-survey.html\">1.8 billion websites<\/a><\/u>\u00a0on the web.
