While there are certainly other web analytic tools around, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Google_Analytics\">Google Analytics<\/a> is one of the greatest and most affordable services with the most intuitive design.<\/p>\n<p>Since Google is the biggest search engine in today&#8217;s time, it&#8217;s easier to get your website ranking higher with their own tools. Here are just some of the things you can do with Google Analytics.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check where your traffic is coming from<\/li>\n<li>Analyze what your audience is doing within your website<\/li>\n<li>Provide details on certain metrics such as page views, unique page views, average time on page, bounce rate, and percent exit.<\/li>\n<li>Check conversions and analyze factors that increase conversion rates<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on whether you are subscribed to the premium service or using it for free, these are some of the most useful things Google Analytics can help you with.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1010996\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/analytics.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"426\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/analytics.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/analytics-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/analytics-600x399.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>2.\u00a0 SEMrush<\/h3>\n<p>Marketed as an all-in-one tool to increase your online visibility, SEMrush is one of the most popular services among marketing agencies.
