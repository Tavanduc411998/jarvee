Keeping track of your analytics can also help in the long run as you are aware of what clicks or flops when it comes to your marketing strategies.<\/p>\n<h3>#2 Weekly To-Do List:<\/h3>\n<p>There are things one should be considering doing on a weekly basis as part of the social media marketer&#8217;s checklist. Expand and develop your networks to engaging and having a relationship with influential personalities in your industry.

When working with a team, be open to comments, suggestions, and even violent reactions to improve your brand overall. It also empowers them as they are seen as vital contributors to your brand, not just task-performers. You can also utilize employee empowerment as a way to market employee relationships in your company, and the brand culture as well.<\/p>\n<p>Assessing your current fanbase and following is part of the weekly to-do list for every social media marketer. Social media itself is very dynamic, thus users are constantly exposed to new and exciting content. Take a better look at the composition of your fanbase and following to know if this demographic is in line with your goals as a brand. You can make the necessary adjustments in your marketing strategy to increase this, or expand to other demographics as well.<\/p>\n<h3>#3 Monthly To-Do List:<\/h3>\n<p>Monthly tasks in every social media marketer&#8217;s checklist are mainly about assessments. You have 30 days\u2019 worth of data and information you can use to decide on maintaining certain strategies, and to adjustment on those needed to help you align your daily tasks with your brand goals. It keeps you and your colleagues focused on what you need to be doing in spite of the many factors affecting your social media marketing statistics.<\/p>\n<p>Identifying key performance indicators beforehand, and assessing these monthly are other important tasks that every social media marketer should add to their to-do list. The amount of data you gathered is sufficient enough to determine the performance of your brand and product in response to your social media marketing strategies. Determine if the number of interactions you are getting, including number of followers and impressions, is on par with the goals you have set for the month.<\/p>\n<p>Another part of the monthly to-do list is assessing your team. Check if every part of your team has been performing and meeting the required goals set individually to impact the team and consequently the brand. Check each person\u2019s performance and decide on their impact on the team. If upon assessment you see that there is a need to delegate tasks to additional personnel, you may make the necessary adjustments as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p>A monthly to-do list for social media marketing managers also involves adjusting monthly brand goal. Keep in mind your overall brand goal when coming up with these to help you be consistent with your brand\u2019s identity. If you were able to meet the current month\u2019s goals or even exceed it, set a higher bar. If not, consider all points in your brand operations to find out what to improve for the next month.<\/p>\n<h3>#4 General Key Points<\/h3>\n<p>Having a clear set of company goals, and even a vision and mission is vital to your daily, weekly and monthly checklist as a social media marketer.
