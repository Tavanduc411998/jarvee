This has been intensified by the pandemic\u2019s persistence and its effects on the global state of businesses.<\/p>\n<p>The name itself, Software as a Service, should be enough to figure out why these businesses <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bmc.com\/blogs\/saas-growth-trends\/#:~:text=By%202021%2C%2073%25%20of%20organizations,already%20invested%20in%20SaaS%20options.&amp;text=Organizations%20with%20250%2B%20employees%20use,50%20SaaS%20solutions%2C%20on%20average.\">perform well during the pandemic<\/a>. The model is usually based on providing a software solution by allowing remote access through cloud technology.<\/p>\n<p>This means that there is absolutely no need for direct interaction between the company and its users. Since software development and maintenance don\u2019t require person-to-person interaction, it makes SaaS a perfect business model for the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, promotion, lead generation, and conversion are still important factors for SaaS businesses, and we\u2019re here to take a closer look at a technique that has gotten quite popular lately &#8211; the use of online quizzes. More specifically, <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-to-solve-common-social-media-marketing-challenges-a-quick-guide\/\">quizzes on social media<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Social media is a pool of opportunities. Especially a platform like Facebook, which is the most popular social media platform with over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/346167\/facebook-global-dau\/\">2.5 billion monthly active users<\/a>, can help your quiz reach more audiences. This certainly shoots up the chances of your quiz going viral.\u00a0 So, if you aren\u2019t leveraging social media, you are missing a good opportunity to boost your business.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Basics of Online Quizzes<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8213\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/social-media-quizzes.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"601\" height=\"439\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/social-media-quizzes.png 601w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/social-media-quizzes-300x219.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Quizzes have been around for quite a while. They are a tried and tested approach to help social media professionals engage their audience. The fact is that interactive content performs much better than passively consumed content.<\/p>\n<p>Quizzes can range from being intended for pure entertainment to being professional surveys that allow businesses to gather valuable insight to provide better services to their customers.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to creating a quiz, at first glance, it may seem like a complicated affair. Still, due to the appearance of quiz builders like ProProfs, we can now <a href=\"https:\/\/www.proprofs.com\/quiz-school\/create-a-quiz\/\">create a quiz<\/a> in no time at all. We can also create templates that allow quick modifications and fast content deployment.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/methods-for-effectively-harnessing-the-power-of-facebook-analytics\/\">implemented analytics help us keep track of results<\/a> and draw valuable conclusions based on user performance.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, it is up to you to decide if you want to create a serious or fun quiz, add photos or videos to it, and adapt it to your audience.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Popular Engagement Approaches <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Now, since we got the introductory part out of the way, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intercom.com\/blog\/ways-to-increase-user-engagement\/\">let\u2019s focus on engagement<\/a> techniques commonly used alongside quizzes.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Engaging specific buyer personas<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Quizzes needn\u2019t precisely be all fun and games. General quizzes are all well and good, but if you have identified specific personas with specific pain points, it only makes sense that you build a quiz around that. This way, when you engage the users that fit into that buyer persona, you\u2019ll have a better chance of making them convert, especially if you suggest a solution to their problem at the end.<\/p>\n<p>This is a very efficient way to create new leads and improve your chances of converting users. You can plainly show how your services resolve the users\u2019 issues and how much better it is than their current way of doing things. All this makes it more likely for them to give your solution a shot.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Showcasing the advantage of using your software<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>There are many ways to approach this one, as the questions should be focused on helping the users realize the advantages of using your software. Thus, the way you\u2019ll approach the creation of the questions depends on what your SaaS business does.<\/p>\n<p>It is good to run the users through some everyday tasks they perform and recall how much time they spend doing it. At the end of the quiz, you could compare their answers to the average time it would take them to do those tasks when using your software.<\/p>\n<p>This outlines the benefits of using your software by comparing their averages to those users while using your SaaS solution. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can work with one of the most trusted and experienced <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.310creative.com\/blog\/saas-marketing-agencies\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SaaS marketing agencies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to help you choose and implement the best strategies in promoting your SaaS products and services.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This is just a broad example; there are numerous other ways to show off your expertise by using quizzes.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Social media &amp; quizzes<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Even though quizzes don\u2019t necessarily need to be shared through social media, more often than not, this is the way they reach users. There are several reasons for this. One of them is that it is the most straightforward way to get a large audience and keep social business accounts engaging.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, social media\u2019s advertising aspect makes it easier to promote the quizzes to a broader audience and build a more significant following for your accounts.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, quizzes are, in most cases, prepared especially for specific social media platforms. Different platforms have vastly different audiences. Therefore, a quiz on Facebook won\u2019t be the same as the quiz on Instagram &#8211; and both of these will be vastly different than the quiz on LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Pure entertainment<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Not all SaaS businesses are going for that corporate tone when addressing their audience. Sure, if you are focusing on a B2B approach, a corporate tone might be appropriate. However, if you are not, there is nothing wrong with putting out content that is strictly focused on engaging users <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/why-publish-content-entertainment-value\">through being entertaining<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The amount of freedom you have here is unsurpassed by any other content type. Naturally, you shouldn\u2019t stray too far away from your primary subject matter as it may be seen as unprofessional, but you can use quizzes to keep up with your audience and divert their attention to your brand even if you don\u2019t have new updates for them.<\/p>\n<p>Keep things light and entertaining, but don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t get as much engagement as you were hoping for right off the bat. Creating fun quizzes can be challenging for people new to quizzes, but with some practice, engagement is bound to go up.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8214\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audience-engagement.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"378\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audience-engagement.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audience-engagement-300x177.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audience-engagement-600x354.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, quizzes allow SaaS brands to develop more significant interactions with users in an engaging and mutually beneficial way. Using quiz builders makes the entire process much easier for those who never created this kind of content before. This means that you won\u2019t have to get specialized employees to build and manage quizzes for you.<\/p>\n<p>It is essential to understand that quizzes are easily kept fresh and engaging. By creating templates, you can quickly change questions, results, and all other accompanying media to develop new content ready to be shared with your audience.<\/p>\n<p>We hope we managed to help you out. Good luck with your quiz creator and may your audience never be bored!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Author Bio<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Angela White is an ed-tech enthusiast with a passion for writing for the consumer market in the areas of product research and marketing using quizzes and surveys.
