From the consumer point of view,\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.com\/us\/en\/industries\/consumer-markets\/library\/covid-19-consumer-behavior-survey.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">research<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0has shown us how the pandemic has affected consumer behavior, and consequently how that, in turn, has affected or at least should affect the behavior of businesses. It is, therefore, important that businesses that hope to survive for the long term need to start now to adapt to these new patterns in consumer behavior if they hope to ride out this Covid wave.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">This article aims to provide you with insightful tips on how best to adapt the marketing of your small business to the \u201cnew\u201d business environment we find ourselves in. They are meant to help your business not only survive through the pandemic but also to serve as a guideline for longer-term resilience and growth.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Top Post Covid Marketing Strategies<\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is an incontrovertible fact of running a business that proper and effective marketing is crucial to the survival of that business. One of the elements of effective marketing is the ability to adapt to the specific circumstances and environment that a business finds itself in at any point in time. The pandemic and the chaos it has caused mean that businesses have to adapt or make some tweaks to how they conduct their businesses, including their marketing function.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The specific tweaks that businesses make to their marketing should ultimately be guided by several parameters like the type of industries they operate in and the type and nature of products or services they provide. Generally speaking, however, some tactics that they can implement to adapt their marketing to the new environment they find themselves in include:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>1. Show empathy to customers<\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Your customers have undoubtedly gone through hard times because of the pandemic and the various measures that were implemented by governments to limit the damage to people\u2019s health and lives. The ultimate goal of your business is to maximize profits but perhaps this is not the time to be thinking about \u201cmaximizing\u201d profits. Perhaps, during this trying period, your business should make empathy its watchword. This can manifest itself in various ways, some examples of which are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Providing (deep) discounts on your products or services.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">A buy now pay later option.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">An option to pay for your product\/service over a period of time.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Becoming involved in any community-related projects aimed at supporting members of the community.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">And more<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>2. Focus on existing customers and benefit from referrals<\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Using and relying on existing customers to bring in new ones is an age-old marketing tactic that is as old as marketing itself. But perhaps it is time to find better and more creative ways to use this method.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Again, as with most things, one size never fits all, so how one business implements this tactic will differ from how another business implements it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">For instance, a\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/dallasbusinesslitigationattorney.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">business lawyer<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0that provides one-off services like entity formation or contract drafting or review for clients might reach out to past clients and ask them if they have a relative or friend who was laid off as a result of the pandemic who is thinking of starting a new business, in which case, the attorney can offer to help them\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/smallbusinessattorneynyc.com\/creating-an-llc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">form an LLC<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0or any other appropriate business entity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Alternatively, a company that is a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider might do things differently and ask existing customers on a one-year contract to get an additional year\u2019s worth of service for free for every 5 people they refer, or whatever is appropriate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Of course, that an existing customer will only be willing to <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/what-is-referral-marketing-examples-and-strategies\/\">refer your business<\/a>, product, or service if they have had a positive experience with it, which is why it is important to ensure that you have a great product or service and that your customer service is top-notch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8221 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/social-media-strategy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/social-media-strategy.jpg 800w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/social-media-strategy-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/social-media-strategy-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/social-media-strategy-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>3. Use social in a more strategic way<\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Most people know the role and importance that social media networks can play in the success of your business. Notwithstanding its positives, social media also has its downsides like its low conversion rates and the potential to get expensive.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The way in which most businesses use social media is by occasionally sharing content on their profile timelines, but perhaps the time has come for you to begin to use social media more strategically.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Some examples of more strategic things and ways that you can use social media include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Instead of only sharing content that you produce, why not find and curate relevant content that other people create and include your own unique take on the content, and perhaps tie it into your product or service.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Run remarketing\/retargeting campaigns on social media to reach people who might have visited specific pages on your website, continuing the job of trying to convince them as to why your product\/service is right for them.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Create a social media community that includes past customers or anyone who has engaged with your product\/service and more importantly, keep that community engaged. This community can easily become a source of referrals.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>4. Identify key advertising channels<\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is arguably the most sustainable way to <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-can-social-media-help-in-your-seo-campaign\/\">grow your business.<\/a> Paid advertising, on the other hand, is probably the fastest way to achieve this objective. The \u2018smart\u2019 business owner will likely want to combine both of these mediums in their effort to try and survive these trying times, but just as importantly, in the longer-term objective of growing their business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">When it comes to paid advertising, whether on social media, display advertising, or on search engines, it is important to be strategic in how you go about it. From identifying the most relevant social media platforms or websites where your potential customers congregate, to being more strategic in how <\/span><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">you advertise to them are just some of the things that you will need to do and consider in your bid to using key advertising mediums to reach your target audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>5. Adopt good communication with customers<\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Besides a terrible product or service and ineffective marketing or sales function, there are very few other things that can \u2018kill\u2019 a business faster than terrible customer service and\/or communication with customers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Research tells us how\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/aircall.io\/blog\/customer-happiness\/missed-calls\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">missed calls<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0to your business and\u00a0<\/span><a class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https:\/\/www.impactplus.com\/blog\/5-dangerous-side-effects-of-bad-customer-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">poor customer service<\/span><\/a><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">\u00a0can result in missed sales or business opportunities, which can be detrimental to the survival or growth of a business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The uncertain environment that we find ourselves in means that most people will likely be even more conscious of how they spend their hard-earned money. It is therefore safe to assume that they will not be too inclined to do business with any company that will not offer them the best possible experience. This experience includes and involves things like your business\u2019s customer service or any other type of communication or engagement they have with your business.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">It is, therefore, very important that you get this very fundamental, yet very important aspect of your business right.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>In conclusion<\/h2>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Indications are that Covid-19 is here to stay and might be with us for a while. It is also very likely that the damage that the pandemic wrought on society will take many years to overcome. All of this does not mean we have to take things lying down. Pandemics and major disruptions to the business environment are not new phenomena. The fact that businesses in the past have been able to survive past pandemics and other major crises means that there is hope that your business will also survive this one, provided you take the necessary steps to do so.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Author Bio<\/h2>\n<p>Kanayo Okwuraiwe is a startup founder and a digital marketing professional.
