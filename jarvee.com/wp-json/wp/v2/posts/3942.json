Today, considering 21<sup>st<\/sup>-century technology, the way we communicate with each other has drastically improved.<\/p>\n<p>This element of cyberspace has become so integral in our daily lives that corporations, big and small, now wire their advertising and marketing efforts to suit such a department in the business realm. In fact, a study shows that nearly 60% of tenured marketers believe that social media is an irreplaceable solution to establishing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mbaskool.com\/business-concepts\/marketing-and-strategy-terms\/10794-brand-recall.html\">brand recall<\/a> and gaining revenue. Conversely, more than 70% of these marketing experts feel that their brands can get better footing over their competitors by using social media more sharply and engagingly.<\/p>\n<p>Fascinatingly, close to 40% of those who took the survey said their companies resorted to social media to further their marketing campaigns and similar initiatives, and just less than a quarter of senior marketers confessed that the companies they work for have long-term social media plans. The findings suggest that marketers who\u2019ve been in the industry long before the internet was ever a tool for promotions believe that social media can radically make a company\u2019s performance with sales better.<\/p>\n<p>Is it critical to invest in social media marketing? Does the space in the digital universe promise a hefty ROI?<\/p>\n<p>The answer to both questions is yes. While there are different marketing methods and strategies, social media marketing can help hasten, if not peak, the financial progress of any given brand. When done right, social media marketing can build brand recall in a span of only a few months. With the influx of online businesses, marketing on social media has bloomed tenfold and has established a completely new district in the digital marketing zone.<\/p>\n<p>Still, social media marketing isn\u2019t exclusive to online businesses. Today, almost every company invests time and money in the said digital facet. Despite the growing number of enterprises subscribing to social media marketing services, not everyone joins the bandwagon, and a few business leaders are still reluctant. After all, traditional media is still relevant.<\/p>\n<p>To this, we ask, how much longer will the same non-digital media platforms remain fresh and relatable? In an era when people consume what they want when they can, and in their most convenient time, how much longer can traditional media keep luring consumers?<\/p>\n<p>Getting into the science and politics of social media marketing can be scary to plenty of entrepreneurial newbies. On the other hand, what other forms of marketing displays real-time reach and market feedback? The next time you, a colleague, or a boss questions the scope and effectivity of social media, refer to the list below.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few essential reasons for companies and brands to invest in social media marketing.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Reach your intended market and turn target customers into repeat consumers<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3947 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/target-market.png\" alt=\"target-market\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/target-market.png 400w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/target-market-300x225.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When you put up a social media account for a business, whether <a href=\"http:\/\/instagram.com\/\">Instagram<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/facebook.com\/\">Facebook<\/a>, or <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/\">Twitter<\/a>, the sites themselves will collect information about the kind of audience your brand is targeting. This makes it a lot easier to display your goods to the right people, wasting no time and money. This is a unique feature that only social media carries.<\/p>\n<p>Social media websites cover the effort and hassle of reaching the people you want. This already subtracts the tasks you have to do, as all you need to focus on is your content and the kind of posts your produce. Of course, as with any platform meant for advertising, money will be shelled out to boost posts, pages, photos, and other similar promos.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Social media is convenient<\/h2>\n<p>The concept of social media customer service isn\u2019t entirely flawless and not so many people resort to FB, IG, or TW when product errors and discomforts arise. In fact, depending on the volume, complexity of the issue, and a company\u2019s number of customer service associates, inquiries and concerns may not be catered to immediately. However, while social media doesn\u2019t entirely promise speed, it does promise convenience.<\/p>\n<p>There is a very high chance, if not wholly a guarantee, that your intended market is already on social media and they spend a lot of time in that space. This claim is further complemented by a study that says social media makes up 30% of an individual\u2019s day. All the more reason to invest and let your brand make waves online.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Promotional strategies are measured easier on social media<\/h2>\n<p>One of the best-known tactics for follower-gaining and page-growing is by creating <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sharethis.com\/best-practices\/2018\/04\/instagram-giveaway-examples\/\">giveaway contests<\/a>. Mostly on the Zuckerberg-built website, marketers may generate buzz by asking people to like a page, tweet their brand, tag a friend, use a hashtag, and subscribe to an online service. In exchange for a premium prize, it\u2019s almost entirely impossible not to join. This is also a great way to evaluate what people are saying about your brand, who they are, what similar pages they like, and other aspects.<\/p>\n<p>This social media strategy may be old, but it continues to be a favorite shortcut among many brands. Who could say no to a coveted item, or an all-expense paid vacation, or a steady supply of a product? People are always ready to tag their family and friends so they can get some free stuff, so this tactic never gets old.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, pages, posts, and channels get more likes and receive more attention. The best part of it is you get all that from the people you want to sell to. If there\u2019s anything that makes word of mouth work for your brand faster than you can imagine, it\u2019s most probably social media platforms. If you\u2019re lucky and people like what you have to offer, your customers will most likely share the page to their friends too.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Social Media Marketing makes it easier to establish brand awareness<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3950 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/bulding-brand-awareness.jpg\" alt=\"bulding brand awareness\" width=\"796\" height=\"566\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/bulding-brand-awareness.jpg 796w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/bulding-brand-awareness-300x213.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/bulding-brand-awareness-768x546.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/bulding-brand-awareness-600x427.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve learned how to tickle your audience\u2019s fancy, the very people who follow your brand on social media may very well be the people who support your business. Moreover, once you\u2019ve made loyal customers, your following will only grow even more, as it\u2019s only natural for happy customers to talk positively about a product or service they get from you.<\/p>\n<p>Nowadays, it\u2019s also quite normal for ordinary followers to like and promote brands out of the abundance of their hearts and out of their respect to what these businesses have to offer. For instance, in the fashion world, there are plenty of people who tag the Instagram accounts of designers and shoe brands that they wear\u2014and these aren\u2019t even sponsorships! Once a business has established a lifestyle name, people will immediately want to associate themselves to their social media.<\/p>\n<p>Again, if you play your cards right, your business\u2019 social media can be your quickest ticket to fame, fortune, and brand recall.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Studies reveal that customer retention can be attributed to social media customer service<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s be honest. At this point, we\u2019re sure you\u2019ve seen hundreds of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stanventures.com\/blog\/social-media-trends-2018\/\">social media trending<\/a> screenshots of conversations between brands and users. Some of them are funny, many are edited, and many are just upsetting. The point is how a brand replies to their followers on social media leaves an impact on the users. Many times, things like this go viral, which can further increase your brand awareness.<\/p>\n<p>However, great customer service through the advent of Facebook and its contemporaries isn\u2019t only about warding off negative feedback and bridging bad publicity. Studies claim that customer service, in general, is a massive determining factor if a customer chooses to stay or not.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond customer engagement, branding is also a huge deal in the equation. So what does customer service have to do with it in the first place, you ask?<\/p>\n<p>The answer is that it helps to form an image. Approachability, humor, uniqueness, and aesthetic are all present components in content and social media posts. The better these things are, the sturdier the social image of a brand is.<\/p>\n<h2>6. Social Media Marketing helps you gauge what your audience is about<\/h2>\n<p>As written earlier, social media enables you to find out what your audience likes and engages with. For instance, over Instagram and Twitter, you can check the hashtags your followers use, and you can examine the profiles of these people.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are they students?<\/li>\n<li>Are they adults?<\/li>\n<li>Are they working individuals?<\/li>\n<li>What are they saying individually that translates to a collective statement?<\/li>\n<li>What formula is best used for people like them?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Surveys are also just as useful on social media to gauge what your audience likes. You\u2019ll be able to find out what they want and how they want your products and services. Although you don\u2019t need to reply to every comment, you should pay attention to what people say. Even better, pay attention to how they\u2019re saying what they\u2019re saying. Understanding whom you serve and the crowd you market for changes how you manage your online presence. Social media is an excellent avenue that gathers immediate feedback.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Author bio<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3953\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Jafar-Sadhik.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" \/>Jafar Sadhik, A passionate digital marketer possessing sound grip in the fields like content writing and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stanventures.com\">fully managed SEO<\/a>.
