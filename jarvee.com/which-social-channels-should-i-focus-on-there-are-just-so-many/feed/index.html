					<description><![CDATA[We all love to be treated as humans, not objects. Social media marketing allows that to companies, to be close to their customers, audience and all others. We became spoiled, we, as customers, want everything and now and on a personal level, so social media is a great tool for marketers to achieve exactly that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This definitely depends on what type of business you run, because not all social networks are appropriate for each type of social network. Better to do a good research than to waste time and money to invest in something that will not bring you money.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, we can establish our presence according to that order, first Facebook then Instagram and the third place Twitter and Pinterest. My humble opinion is that the Pinterest offers more than Twitter. Twitter became more popular after Trump was elected for the president because that&#039;s his favorite media, but in basic Pinterst is suitable for businesses.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would say that you have to exist on Instagram and Facebook at least. Because first thing people will do when they want to find out more about your brand is to look for you there. Maybe you will be investing more in one of these two or some third social network, but you should be present and have some information about your brand on Instagram and Facebook.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you&#039;re on a free trial and didn&#039;t create subscription, there&#039;s nothing to cancel. If you created subscription before trial ended, then just go to My Account &gt; My subscription tab and click on Cancel subscription. That&#039;s all. You can also contact support and we&#039;ll check do you actually have subscription or not, then cancel it if that&#039;s what you want. But why would you want that? :)]]></description>
