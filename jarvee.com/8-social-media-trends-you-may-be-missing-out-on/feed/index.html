					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s 2020 and these are still trends that some social media users are missing out  It&#039;s interesting that these are still trends that are valid, but they developed in different directions. Looking forward to seeing what the future will bring. Thanks for sharing!]]></description>

Influencers are people who have spent time building their own brand and cultivating their audience that are genuinely respecting their opinion. They are respective about their reputation and they will not just promote anything for money. When they tell you good about something that means that they are telling you the truth.]]></description>

Adam - I&#039;m searching for instances of my name being spoofed (or accounts hacked).  I don&#039;t think there is another Bill Dachelet alive and the above message didn&#039;t come from me.  I think you may have replied to a bot of some kind.  Just fyi.  Since I&#039;m being paranoid, I&#039;m putting fake info in the contact stuff below - sorry about that.]]></description>

It will be hard to do multiple niches on the same site unless you&#039;re huge, like Amazon on the likes. I&#039;d recommend you do one niche per site or strap in for the very long run.]]></description>
