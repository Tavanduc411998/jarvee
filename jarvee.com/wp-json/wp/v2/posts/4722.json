Instagram made new changes to their algorithm starting June and these blocks started to happen more and more.<\/p>\n<p>There are many theories out there, some more decent than others. It is not yet known though if these blocks are totally intentional or just an error on their part. This is due to the fact that a lot of regular people that have never used automation in their life seem to be getting blocked as well. It might be a new spam filter gone bad, an error on their part, or they are just testing around until they find the sweet spot.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever it is, it is clear that they are serious about stopping the people that want to use their platform for marketing and they are growing their accounts organically rather than paying for their ads.<\/p>\n<p>There are many things that can be said about this, however most is just speculation. What we can do is see how to deal with the problem with the tools we have at our disposal.<\/p>\n<p>First of all we should all understand that the age of following\/unfollowing 1000 people per day is gone. It was fun while it lasted, however we do need to focus on other strategies to help grow our accounts.<\/p>\n<p>Instagram was incredibly permissive with their daily limits for the follow tool \u2013 let\u2019s be serious, no normal user follows and unfollows that much each and every day. There are good things about this though:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many spammers will give up on Instagram automation which means that your targeted audience will be receiving fewer notifications overall, thus yours will get noticed faster.<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s probably the end of \u201csocial signal panels\u201d or they will get extremely expensive since it will be harder than ever to provide such a service so again, there will be more place for your accounts to shine<\/li>\n<li>You\u2019ll have the time to learn and implement new strategies to get more attention on your account and when you\u2019ll be able to follow again you\u2019ll get better results with fewer actions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Why was everyone using the follow-unfollow method so much ?<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because it was the easiest! Every new person coming to Instagram \u201cmarketing\u201d read that one first. You follow and unfollow enough people and eventually your account will grow. From now on you\u2019ll have to think more, to create a strategy and do everything you can to get more targeted eyeballs on your account. There are a lot of other actions you can do on Instagram to attract attention, you\u2019ve just probably never bothered with them till now.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4730\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/going-forward-after-the-instagram-blocks.jpg\" alt=\"going forward after the instagram blocks\" width=\"1061\" height=\"719\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/going-forward-after-the-instagram-blocks.jpg 1061w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/going-forward-after-the-instagram-blocks-300x203.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/going-forward-after-the-instagram-blocks-768x520.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/going-forward-after-the-instagram-blocks-1024x694.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/going-forward-after-the-instagram-blocks-600x407.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1061px) 100vw, 1061px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So let\u2019s see what exactly you can do to get over this dark period.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Use the contact tool more<\/h3>\n<p>This doesn\u2019t mean you should start spamming messages now. Be smart, take it easy, try to look like a normal user so they will have no reason to block any action you do. Start slow and do more actions gradually. Here\u2019s what you can do:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/knowledge-base\/instagram-contact-tool\/\">Contact Tool<\/a> to promote your brand by dropping a message to probable clients.<\/li>\n<li>You can message people who liked and commented on your posts or target posts.<\/li>\n<li>Express your gratitude to those who have interacted with your content, answer queries and at the same time grab the opportunity to disseminate key details about your product.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>2. Post to your Stories as well<\/h3>\n<p>Posting quality content on your accounts is a must but as a supplement, you can publish to your Stories multiple times a day.<\/p>\n<p>You take advantage of this Instagram feature to encourage engagement on your account.<\/p>\n<p>Experiment on the different things you can accomplish when you post to your Stories as discussed on <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-instagram-stories-can-enhance-account-growth\/\">How Instagram Stories Can Enhance Account Growth<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>3. Use the Like, Comment, Story Viewer and the Like Comments tools<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Liking Posts &#8211; You can use the <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/knowledge-base\/instagram-like-tool\/\">Like Tool<\/a> and start giving likes to posts published by people of your preferred niche.<\/li>\n<li>Comment on Posts &#8211; \u00a0Leave a warm and genuine comment on the posts that are relevant to your niche using the <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/knowledge-base\/instagram-comment-tool\/\">Comment Tool<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>View Stories &#8211; The <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/knowledge-base\/instagram-story-viewer-tool\/\">Story Viewer Tool<\/a> is one of the recommended actions you can execute when warming up the accounts all the way to maturity. You can choose to view stories of people who engaged with your target posts, your own followings, and more.<\/li>\n<li>Liking Comments &#8211; Show acknowledgement to people who leave comments not just on your posts but on posts applicable to your market. Use the <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/knowledge-base\/the-instagram-like-comments-tool\/\">Like Comments Tool<\/a> and start giving hearts where it is needed.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>4. Use the delete posts tool<\/h3>\n<p>Keep a well structured profile, tidy up your account\u2019s wall and make it enticing. You can use the Delete Posts Tool to remove irrelevant contents and retain quality posts or posts that have high engagement.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Take advantage of the Like Exchange tool to rank your posts higher for related hashtags<\/h3>\n<p>Ranking your posts in the hashtags section related to your niche is one of the most important ways you can grow your Instagram account organically and we developed a tool that can help greatly with that, it\u2019s called the Like Exchange and you can read more about how it works here: <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/knowledge-base\/the-like-exchange-tool\/\">The Like Exchange Tool<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure you publish high quality posts and use the right hashtags. You can read the following guide on how to do hashtag research: <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/complete-hashtag-research-for-any-niche-with-jarvee\/\">Complete Instagram Hashtag Research for Any Niche With JARVEE<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In the last update we added the following feature:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCampaign Instagram &#8211; Added option in Overview Advanced Settings Instagram to Add alt text to your image posts. Enable it if you want alt text to be posted. Very useful for SEO, you can read about the option here : https:\/\/blog.iconosquare.com\/instagram-alt-text\/ \u201c<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to take advantage of that feature as it will help rank your posts for those hashtags, just make sure you use the right relevant words and hashtags inside the alt image text.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Keep using the follow\/unfollow strategy but at a much slower pace.<\/h3>\n<p>All these changes don\u2019t mean the follow-unfollow strategy is dead. You just need to be more careful about it, better target the people you want to follow so you don\u2019t waste actions on bot, dead or useless accounts.<\/p>\n<p>Keep it slow, many people are talking about a 6000 follow limit within a 30 day period, that would mean a maximum of 200 follows per day. I\u2019d say that is still too much, but it\u2019s up to you. If you have several accounts feel free to test for yourself. Even with 100 highly targeted follows per days you will do fine. Try to use the sniper approach instead of the shotgun one.<\/p>\n<p>If you had\/have a block on your account wait for it to pass. Then start following again very very slowly. I\u2019d give it a week after the block was lifted and start with 10 follows per day and grow it daily with 1-2 more follows. Baby steps but you will get there!<\/p>\n<h3>7. Ultimately \u2013 Instagram is not the only answer, promote your Instagram account on other social networks as well<\/h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t set your social media marketing strategy in a way that it only focuses or relies too much on one social media network, a lot of businesses were hit hard in the last few months when Facebook updated their algorithm and decreased pages reach.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, businesses who didn\u2019t focus solely on Facebook weren\u2019t affected as much.<\/p>\n<p>Below, I will mention a few methods you can use to promote your business on other Social Networks as well.<\/p>\n<p>If you are an agency and using Jarvee to grow your clients Instagram Accounts, you can use these methods to promote their Instagram Accounts and once you get familiar with a specific Social Network, you can add it to the list of your services.<\/p>\n<p>I will keep things short so this post doesn\u2019t turn into a book, you can also use Google to find other strategies to promote your business on Social Media:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>Use the <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/knowledge-base\/finder\/\">Group Finder Tool<\/a> to find niche related groups and use the <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/knowledge-base\/joiner\/\">Joiner Tool<\/a> to join them and then promote your business or account there (<a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/post-facebook-groups-without-getting-penalized\/\">How To Post On Facebook Groups Without Getting Penalized<\/a>).<\/li>\n<li>Extract pages likers or group members and send them a friend request and then message them about your business using the <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-to-use-the-facebook-contact-tool-in-jarvee\/\">Contact Tool<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Use the <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/knowledge-base\/fb-comment-like\/\">Comment &amp; Like Tool <\/a>to comment on posts.<\/li>\n<li>Use the <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/knowledge-base\/facebook-like-comments\/\">Like Comments Tool <\/a>to like users comments on posts related to your niche.
