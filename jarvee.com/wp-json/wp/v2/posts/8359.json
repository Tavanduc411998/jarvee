It<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">&#8216;<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">s what we know, what we love, what makes us feel all warm and fuzzy inside. In this day and age<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">,<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">\u00a0when everything seems to be moving so fast and changing even faster, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedoe.com\/narratives\/why-the-90s-was-best-decade-ever-a-nostalgic-love-letter\">looking back to the past<\/a> might just be what people need.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">\u00a0<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Nostalgia is one of the most powerful emotions people can experience.
