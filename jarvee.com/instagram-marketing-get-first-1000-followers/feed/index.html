					<description><![CDATA[I think that most important thing is to create good media for your profile. Because Instagram is all about visual and it&#039;s users are attracted with great images and interesting videos.  

Hashtags are on the second place as this helps you to put your content in front of users that are interested in what you have to offer. If your content is good enough, they will be interested to check out your profiles.

Thanks for the tips, it&#039;s appreciated.]]></description>
