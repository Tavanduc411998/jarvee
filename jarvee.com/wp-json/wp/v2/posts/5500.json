This is a critical mistake for international businesses because everyone uses it these days. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/295611\/taiwan-social-network-penetration\/\">Taiwan has a 90 percent Facebook penetration rate<\/a>; this makes a lack of localization a very bad idea for international companies operating in the country.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we\u2019re going to give you 5 excellent reasons why you should make localized social media posts an indispensable part of your content marketing strategy:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Localized social media content makes a business look more customer-centered<\/li>\n<li>Localized social media content directs more traffic toward your website<\/li>\n<li>Localized social media content increases engagement<\/li>\n<li>Localized social media content builds trust<\/li>\n<li>Localized social media content increases sales.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Reason #1: Localized content Makes a Business Look More Customer-Centered<\/h2>\n<p>Customer focus is everything for businesses these days. By putting themselves in the situations experienced by the target audiences, you\u2019re much more likely to understand things from their perspective. In turn, this makes you better understand them, so it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll be able to create relationships with them easier.<\/p>\n<p>What role do localized social media posts play here?<\/p>\n<p>Any localized content, be it a social media post or a blog article, improves customer experience. Offering content in a form customers prefer makes it easier for them to connect with you, thus helping to build trust and credibility.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why customer experience has become a huge differentiator for modern businesses. In fact, studies have confirmed that companies consider <a href=\"https:\/\/www.superoffice.com\/blog\/customer-experience-statistics\/\">this factor as \u201cthe most exciting business opportunity.\u201d<\/a><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Localized-content-Makes-a-Business-Look-More-Customer-Centered.jpg\" alt=\"Localized content Makes a Business Look More Customer-Centered\" width=\"581\" height=\"402\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5502\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Localized-content-Makes-a-Business-Look-More-Customer-Centered.jpg 581w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Localized-content-Makes-a-Business-Look-More-Customer-Centered-300x208.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, customer experience even overtook such important factors as<a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/5-tips-to-make-fantastic-videos-for-your-social-networks\/\"> video marketing<\/a> and social media. With 86 percent of customers willing to pay more for great customer experience, localizing your content would definitely be a step in the right direction for you.<\/p>\n<p>Not only does it make your brand look more customer-focused and professional, but it also says that you\u2019re willing to invest in something that makes your target audience feel more special.<\/p>\n<h2>Reason #2: Localized Content Directs More Traffic Toward Your Website<\/h2>\n<p>This one is pretty simple: a customer would be much more likely to click on a localized social media post rather and go to your website. If they see that the content is tailored to their unique circumstances, preferences, and experiences, their confidence to click would be greater.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you can start by including a local website\u2019s URL in your social media profile, just like Starbucks Mexico does below.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/include-a-local-website-URL-in-your-social-media-profile.jpg\" alt=\"include a local website URL in your social media profile\" width=\"624\" height=\"164\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5503\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/include-a-local-website-URL-in-your-social-media-profile.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/include-a-local-website-URL-in-your-social-media-profile-300x79.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/include-a-local-website-URL-in-your-social-media-profile-600x158.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Also, if you create a post about a sale in a store in a specific location, you\u2019ll maximize the relevance of this content for your target audience residing in that area.<\/p>\n<p>The Polish subsidiary of Jysk, a well-known Danish retail chain, often shares social media posts with discounts. To get them, you need to go to their regional website, of course, as shown in the screenshot below.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/share-social-media-posts-with-discounts.jpg\" alt=\"share social media posts with discounts\" width=\"506\" height=\"561\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5504\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/share-social-media-posts-with-discounts.jpg 506w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/share-social-media-posts-with-discounts-271x300.jpg 271w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, the post contains multiple offers and provides a short link to the website. By sharing similar posts, the company drives more people to their local online store. Even someone who\u2019s interested in browsing the products would be compelled to go to the website because Jysk gives an additional 10 percent discount on top of holiday discounts.<\/p>\n<p>The main reason why posts like these get a lot of clicks is that they<strong> provide a positive customer experience<\/strong>. There\u2019s evidence to support this, too: one study found that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.business2community.com\/branding\/brand-trust-is-more-important-than-ever-for-consumers-02229321\">73 percent of buyers considered customer experience important<\/a> to make purchasing decisions.<\/p>\n<p>So, by increasing the relevance of the content, you\u2019re also improving people\u2019s experience with it, so a lot of them will be able to go to your website and check out more stuff.<\/p>\n<p>One more thing: keep in mind that consistency is key to driving website traffic continuously, so consider using <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/jarvee-social-media-scheduler-features\/\">social media automation<\/a> software to ensure that your posts get published on time.<\/p>\n<h2>Reason #3: Localized Content Increases Engagement<\/h2>\n<p>This one is obvious at this point: if people consider content relevant and easy to understand, chances are more will engage with it somehow, like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>click on a link in a post and go to your website<\/li>\n<li>share content on social media with their friends<\/li>\n<li>convert, i.e., start a free trial or sign up for a newsletter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let me cite a study that showed how powerful localization can be for engagement.<\/p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/mobilemarketingwatch.com\/language-localization-drives-higher-mobile-ad-engagement-40878\">this article<\/a>, the CEO of an ad distribution network says they compared the performance of ads in English and three other languages, namely German, French, and Spanish. The network displayed the ads in a local language and English for a period of time and found some pretty interesting results.<\/p>\n<table width=\"624\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"208\">Performance indicator\/Languages<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">Ads in English<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">Ads in Local Language<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"208\">Click-through rate<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">2.35 percent<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">3.34 percent<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"208\">Conversion rate<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">7.47 percent<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">9.08 percent<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>The localized ads performed much better compared to their English counterparts, suggesting that localizing customer experience is totally worth it. In other words, people are reluctant to buy a product or service they don\u2019t understand (or understand them partly).<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to keep time differences in mind when posting for international social media accounts. If you can\u2019t be online on Facebook due to time differences but need to publish posts, be sure to use <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/facebook-marketing-features\/\">social media automation tools to reach local customers<\/a> when they are most engaged.<\/p>\n<h2>Reason #4: Localized Content Builds Trust<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve touched this area a bit already, but it deserves a separate section. When your social media followers see that you\u2019re trying to ensure that your content is easy to understand, they will definitely appreciate it. Moreover, they will understand that you\u2019re making an effort to communicate in a way they prefer.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/try-to-ensure-that-your-content-is-easy-to-understand.jpg\" alt=\"try to ensure that your content is easy to understand\" width=\"624\" height=\"400\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5505\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/try-to-ensure-that-your-content-is-easy-to-understand.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/try-to-ensure-that-your-content-is-easy-to-understand-300x192.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/try-to-ensure-that-your-content-is-easy-to-understand-600x385.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><br \/>\n<center>Source: the official Spanish Samsung account, Instagram<\/center><\/p>\n<p>Building trust requires communicating in a culturally appropriate way, too, according to Jessica Curry, a localization expert from <a href=\"https:\/\/thewordpoint.com\/services\/certified\/marriage-certificates\">TheWordPoint<\/a>, a translation service. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to make a mistake because something innocent in one country can be considered offensive in another, that\u2019s why hire a local professional to help if you can.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>People often buy from companies that they like and trust, so localize your content to foster trust and make them feel like you understand their needs.<\/p>\n<h2>Reason #5: Localized Content Increases Sales<\/h2>\n<p>There are many ways in which social media content localization can help you improve sales. First and foremost, it makes your offers more relevant and interesting for customers; as the ad study described above showed, this really works.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/make-your-offers-more-relevant-and-interesting-for-customers.jpg\" alt=\"make your offers more relevant and interesting for customers\" width=\"624\" height=\"400\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5506\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/make-your-offers-more-relevant-and-interesting-for-customers.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/make-your-offers-more-relevant-and-interesting-for-customers-300x192.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/make-your-offers-more-relevant-and-interesting-for-customers-600x385.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><br \/>\n<center>Credit: KFC Canada<\/center><\/p>\n<p>Also, you can adapt to local pricing and buying capacity to optimize offers for local markets. It makes no sense to use international currencies in countries where they accept only local ones; moreover, you should consider the purchasing power of the local customer.<\/p>\n<p>For example, what may seem like a good deal in one country can be too expensive in another (there can be differences between regions, too). This also means that your business should consider the percentage of coupon codes, special offers, and discounts.<\/p>\n<h2>The Bottom Line<\/h2>\n<p>You need much more than translated social media posts to say that your strategy is truly localized. As you can see, there are things like buying power, cultural appropriateness, customer experience, localized offers, and others to consider. Doing so is definitely a challenge, but taking advantage of localization to increase the relevance and quality of your content makes perfect sense.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully, these five reasons have been convincing enough for you to try social media content localization. This brings us to the first sentence &#8211; there\u2019s a misconception about location, so if you do it right, chances are you\u2019ll get ahead of the competition.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the author<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Erica Sunajo has a Creative Writing degree from South Texas College and works as a freelance writer, and proofreader at <a href=\"http:\/\/bestwritersonline.com\/best-dissertation-writing-service\">BestWritersOnline<\/a>.
