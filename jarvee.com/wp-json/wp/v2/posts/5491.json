This is why it\u2019s vital to make sure you\u2019re spending the time to get things right.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re promoting a product, highlighting a service you offer or simply raising awareness of your brand, you should always spend time creating and writing ad copy that\u2019s crafted to make an impact. While there\u2019s no hard and fast rule to this, there are several tips you can follow to get the best results.<\/p>\n<p>With this in mind, today we\u2019re going to explore the top five tried and tested ad copywriting techniques out there, giving you everything you need to know to create twitter promoting that converts.<\/p>\n<h2>#1 &#8211; Add a Time Limit<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s no better way to create a bit of pressure surrounding your ad that adding a time limit to it. If people see an offer, they may not think much of it or see the urgency behind the message you are trying to convey; they\u2019ll come back and have a look when they can be bothered. However, if it\u2019s only available for 24-hours, they\u2019ll be much more likely to click through immediately and be tempted to see what the commotion might be all about.<\/p>\n<p>Statistically speaking, if you get 30% more people to click through an ad because they want to make sure they don\u2019t miss out on what you to offer, and you average a 3% conversion rate, this could be a huge number of new, profitable customers.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5495\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Add-a-Time-Limit.jpg\" alt=\"Add a Time Limit\" width=\"628\" height=\"628\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Add-a-Time-Limit.jpg 628w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Add-a-Time-Limit-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Add-a-Time-Limit-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Add-a-Time-Limit-600x600.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>#2 &#8211; Avoid Hashtags Where Possible<\/h2>\n<p>Hashtags on Twitter are designed to increase engagement of your posts and to spread reach by appearing on trending feeds, news outlets and serving as a mediating link for articles, songs and other forms of social media. Of course, this is great if this is what you want to achieve, yet with a Twitter ad, this is not the primary goal. The primary goal is instead to have people click through to your website.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/michellegreenwald\/2019\/08\/05\/14-strategic-uses-of-brand-hashtags-and--clever-placements\/\">Hashtags<\/a>, though helpful for promoting slogans, key words and even brands, can not only be distracting to the readers but can also eat up valuable character space where you could focus on providing more value with your message, so try to avoid using them unless you absolutely have to.<\/p>\n<p>Hashtags on Twitter can be a bittersweet thing. While it\u2019s tempting to go straight for high-performing tags, you have to remember there\u2019s a lot of competition there and your ad might get lost in the stream of others. Sometimes, it can be way more effective to target a less competitive tag with fewer results, so that in the long run you stand out from the crowd and make an everlasting impression exactly because of this.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5496\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Avoid-Hashtags-Where-Possible.jpg\" alt=\"Avoid Hashtags Where Possible\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Avoid-Hashtags-Where-Possible.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Avoid-Hashtags-Where-Possible-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Avoid-Hashtags-Where-Possible-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>#3 &#8211; It\u2019s All About the CTA<\/h2>\n<p>Just because you have a limit character space, that doesn\u2019t mean you should flunk out of the call to action. Just like all other kinds of sales copy, the call to action is one of the most important aspects of the content to help guide your reader on what you want them to do next.<\/p>\n<p>Are you learning to get them to click through and \u2018learn about something today,\u2019 or do they need \u2018reserve their space now,\u2019 or \u2018buy something before stock runs out\u2019?<\/p>\n<p>Implement smart and concise calls to action at the end of your content to help your readers easily take the first steps into your sales funnel.<\/p>\n<h2>#4 &#8211; Offer Value for Free<\/h2>\n<p>It might seem counter-productive to offer something for <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2008\/05\/how-to-sell-services-more-profitably\">free<\/a>, but in fact, this can be one of the best ways to draw people into your business and to take the opportunity to really celebrate your work. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re offering an online course and you want to start selling it to people.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of advertising the course for $500, you could instead slim the course down to a bare minimum course, maybe in the form of an eBook, and then offer that out for free. Of course, you could also ask for their email address in exchange for course, helping to grow your email list.<\/p>\n<p>Once people have used the eBook, they will then want to learn more in more detail, which is when you can then offer your course. Since people already trust what you have to say, you\u2019ll be much more likely to create future purchase opportunities and foster an ongoing relationship.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t need to create something from scratch for it to be free. Of course, you want to provide value in your free offering, but you don\u2019t want to get to the point where the content is meaningless and rushed. Think of this as a free trial or sample and give your readers every reason to want to click through and purchase whatever you\u2019re offering.<\/p>\n<p>Talking about value and your services, it\u2019s more eye catching to advertise discounts as \u2018%\u2019 off rather than display that in monetary figures. For example, saying \u201830% off\u2019 sounds better than \u2018$15 off\u2019 a certain product.<\/p>\n<h2>#5 &#8211; Implement Questions<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s all well and good having people read your Twitter Ad copy while promoting and trying to write convert content, but unless you\u2019re getting inside the heads of your readers, most people won\u2019t think about what you\u2019ve got to say twice.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, you can get your readers thinking by implementing <a href=\"https:\/\/business.twitter.com\/en\/blog\/Twitter-Ads-experts-answer-campaign-questions.html\">questions<\/a> into your Twitter copy and engaging with them. Ask meaningful and purposeful questions that make your readers want to click through to get an answer.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5497\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Implement-Questions.jpg\" alt=\"Implement Questions\" width=\"768\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Implement-Questions.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Implement-Questions-300x209.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Implement-Questions-600x417.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>#6 \u2013 Monitor your stats<\/h2>\n<p>By setting goals and monitoring your <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/twitter-ads\/\">stats<\/a> by demographics, app installs, followers, tweet engagements, website clicks or conversions, app re-engagements, in-stream video views. By observing fluctuations and trends in these groups, you can tailor and continue to advertise your content and services depending on what spikes interest.<\/p>\n<p>By employing these tips, setting realistic goals and keeping your lines of communication open with prospective interested users, it is very likely your business approach will entice them to click through. Once they\u2019ve clicked through, you can then rely on your landing page copy to take care of the rest.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the author<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Aimee Laurence is a social media marketer and writer at <a href=\"https:\/\/academized.com\/writing-services\/write-my-dissertation\">Write My Dissertation<\/a>and <a href=\"https:\/\/ukwritings.com\/coursework-service\">Coursework Writing Service<\/a>.
