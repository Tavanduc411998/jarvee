They can consume hours of your time in the evenings and weekends while you iron out all the kinks.<\/p>\n<p>For many, that\u2019s where it ends. For others, their side project has the potential to help thousands or even millions of people. The only problem is that it\u2019s not going to do that unless you put in the effort.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that\u2019s much easier said than done. This blog has already covered the <u><a href=\"https:\/\/looka.com\/blog\/side-hustle-how-to-succeed\/\">main considerations for a side hustle<\/a><\/u> to improve your chances of long-term success.<\/p>\n<p>This guide will drill down into specific strategies you can use to market your side project, get those initial customers, and eventually <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/useful-tips-on-how-to-help-your-startup-grow-with-social-media\/\">scale to startup success<\/a>. Even if that\u2019s not your goal, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll still find this guide useful. Let\u2019s dive in.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>How to market your side project? <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Some of these side hustle marketing ideas may seem obvious or common wisdom but don\u2019t take them for granted. The key with all of them isn\u2019t to <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kyleads.com\/blog\/demand-generation\/\">generate demand from scratch<\/a><\/u> but to tap into existing demand. They\u2019ve been used by some of the most successful organizations in the world to get initial traction and eventually scale.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>SEO (search engine optimization)<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>SEO is first on this list for a reason. It takes the longest to start seeing results and, in many cases, it can produce more customers than any other channel. People love it so much because once it starts, it can go on indefinitely without much additional input.<\/p>\n<p>Climbing the SERPs is the hardest part. If you search how to do SEO online, there are countless articles, videos, and even <a href=\"https:\/\/drcourses.com\/\">business courses<\/a> that cover the topic. Yes, it can be complicated but not as difficult as it\u2019s made to seem.<\/p>\n<p>There are a few main pillars of SEO (not everyone will agree with me but I speak from personal experience).<\/p>\n<h3>1. On-page SEO<\/h3>\n<p>This is a broad term that encompasses many things such as the keywords you target, the way you structure your pages with those keywords and their LSI, and the overall user experience (how easy the page is to navigate, speed, etc.). Focus on <u><a href=\"https:\/\/looka.com\/blog\/how-to-use-content-marketing-to-grow-your-business\/\">creating great content<\/a><\/u> to get on-page SEO right.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Relevance and intent<\/h3>\n<p>Page optimization goes beyond stuffing keywords throughout the content. What you write about should match the intent of the searcher. For example, a post title \u2018best protein powders\u2019 shouldn\u2019t only talk about your protein powder.<\/p>\n<p>Another thing to consider is your entire website relevant to that topic? If you\u2019re a marketing website and start talking about how to groom pets, it doesn\u2019t matter how good the content is, search engines probably won\u2019t rank because it\u2019s not relevant to the core topic of the website.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Link building<\/h3>\n<p>If you want to rank in search engines, you\u2019ll have to build links from other authoritative websites in a relevant niche. This is how Google and other search engines determine the quality of your content and the authority of your website.<\/p>\n<p>When done well, you can have explosive results that translate into revenue but it takes time to see those results.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8676\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/link-building.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"310\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/link-building.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/link-building-300x149.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/link-building-600x298.png 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/link-building-573x285.png 573w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In the image above, it took the brand roughly three years to get to 100,000 visitors a month then another three years to get to 340,000+ monthly visitors. Today, search engines are responsible for the majority of its traffic and revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Most people don\u2019t have a few years to wait around before they start getting results so there are other methods that come into play.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Get active in niche communities <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Forums and other niche communities are often overlooked as viable marketing channels because it\u2019s all about scale and traction these days.\u00a0 Niche communities can deliver all of that and more.<\/p>\n<p>Before someone signs up for a fashion forum, car forum, business forum, etc. you can bet that they\u2019re more interested in most. They want to interact with like minds, trade war stories, and grow any way they can.<\/p>\n<p>You can get active within niche forums and position yourself as an authority while growing your side project. There are a few things to keep in mind.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Choose the top three forums in your niche in terms of members and activity.<\/li>\n<li>You should post regularly and build clout before mentioning your product<\/li>\n<li>Your product\/service should only come up when it\u2019s relevant to the comment or thread.<\/li>\n<li>If the community offers a signature, optimize it with a link back to your website<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8678\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/niche-forum.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"259\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/niche-forum.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/niche-forum-300x125.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/niche-forum-600x249.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In the end, forum marketing through niche communities follows the rules of decency. You don\u2019t want to spam your link, be sure to add value, and post as often as you can. If you can dedicate 20 \u2013 30 minutes a day to this strategy then you\u2019ll start to get results.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Integrate with popular app\/service directories <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you were building a company that absolutely had to replace your day job, I would hesitate to recommend using integrations as a primary growth driver. It puts you at risk from the platform you\u2019re using.<\/p>\n<p>The platform could decide to delist you, change its policies so you\u2019re no longer relevant, or build a competing feature. With that being said, it can get you traction early. If you\u2019re featured at the top of an app directory for a popular platform like Shopify, you may get tens of thousands of views a day.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8681\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/shopify.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/shopify.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/shopify-300x126.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/shopify-600x253.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As long as your side hustle gives people what they\u2019re looking for, that can translate into hundreds of new customers. These customers are essentially free so you\u2019re <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.growthboost.co\/blog\/5-ways-to-make-your-online-business-more-profitable\/\">even more profitable<\/a><\/u> than if you used other acquisition channels.<\/p>\n<p>The first step is to identify the platforms that will give you the most bang for your buck. This will depend heavily on the type of project you have.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re offering email marketing consulting services, you may want to get certified as a Mailchimp expert. You then have the option of being listed in its service directory.<\/p>\n<p>If you create a business application, the following directories may be a great option.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Slack<\/li>\n<li>Webflow<\/li>\n<li>Salesforce<\/li>\n<li>Shopify<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The key here is to find two or more relevant app or service directories from well-known organizations. All you need are a few customers from these channels every day or week for it to be worth it.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Document your journey publicly <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Radical transparency is difficult to do. Sharing the entire journey of your side hustle publicly, including the wins and losses, can be daunting. It\u2019s the losing part that makes transparency so hard because we often put winners on a pedestal.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a truth many people don\u2019t realize. When you share your journey, it gives your side project a human face and will attract people to your brand. If they feel you\u2019re authentic, they\u2019ll root for you and support you in any way they can.<\/p>\n<p>The support usually comes in the form of buying what you\u2019re selling. Even if it\u2019s not 100% ready or even if it\u2019s a little more expensive.<\/p>\n<p>The movement to be radically transparent is often referred to as <strong>open startups<\/strong> and many organizations have taken this route.<\/p>\n<p>The founder of Groove, Alex Turnbull blogged his company\u2019s entire journey from 0 to $100,000\/m in revenue.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8675\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Groove.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"289\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Groove.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Groove-300x139.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Groove-600x278.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Then, he blogged about it from $100,000\/m to $500,000\/m. Then, he blogged from $500,000\/m to $10,000,000\/year. At every step, he had people rooting for him.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, when he stopped sharing so much of their journey because he thought it wouldn\u2019t be interesting to most folks, his fans rebelled. <strong>They demanded more.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>While you may not have results as amazing as Groove, you can still build goodwill and remain top of mind. When your reader needs a product like yours, they\u2019ll buy it from you or, at least, recommend it to a friend, colleague, or family member.<\/p>\n<p>You can spend an hour or two a week recapping your progress, the next steps, and sharing it in key places.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Create a niche resource\u00a0 <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>What is something you can make that\u2019s relevant to your target audience but doesn\u2019t have to be directly tied to your core project?<\/p>\n<p>Let me give you an example, if you serve an audience of social media managers, you could put together a <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/top-9-social-media-content-optimization-tools-for-2021\/\">collection of the best social media tools<\/a>. It\u2019s relevant to them but may not be directly related to your product or service.<\/p>\n<p>Even though that\u2019s the case, your brand will still get visibility and a few people may decide to purchase. Niche resources can be a small tool like a <u><a href=\"https:\/\/coschedule.com\/headline-analyzer\/\">headline analyzer<\/a><\/u>, <u><a href=\"https:\/\/usefulpdf.com\/pdf-to-word\">a PDF converter<\/a><\/u>, or a well-designed collection of the best vendors for a certain outcome.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever you choose, make sure it\u2019s relevant.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8680\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Startup-Stash.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Startup-Stash.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Startup-Stash-300x126.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Startup-Stash-600x253.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Startup Stash is a collection of hundreds of tools in dozens of categories that caters to startups. It started as a resource that helped the creator sell their own services. Eventually, it took on a life of its own.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to go as far as this. Something as simple as a calculator may be enough to generate interest from your target audience.<\/p>\n<p>Just make sure it\u2019s:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Simple to use<\/li>\n<li>Solves a small but clear problem<\/li>\n<li>Doesn\u2019t take <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursesforsuccess.com\/blog\/motivation\/6031-how-to-improve-time-management-skills-\">much time<\/a><\/u> or energy to maintain<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><strong>Summing up <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Side projects or side hustle is the new black.
