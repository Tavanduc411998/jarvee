Some of them are successful, and some should go by a long path through the thorns to the stars. How to make this path less harmful? This is the reason to turn for advice to more experienced entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we show you some examples of successful companies and review the reasons why brands should be transparent from the very beginning. These points are the answers to question on how to stay honest on the market with significant competition.<\/p>\n<p>Is brand transparency a real key to win a customer\u2019s heart? Let\u2019s get closer to it!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Brand-Transparency-Is-This-the-Key-Step-to-Winning-Customers\u2019-Hearts.jpg\" alt=\"Brand Transparency - Is This the Key Step to Winning Customers\u2019 Hearts\" width=\"643\" height=\"428\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6345\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Brand-Transparency-Is-This-the-Key-Step-to-Winning-Customers\u2019-Hearts.jpg 643w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Brand-Transparency-Is-This-the-Key-Step-to-Winning-Customers\u2019-Hearts-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Brand-Transparency-Is-This-the-Key-Step-to-Winning-Customers\u2019-Hearts-600x399.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 643px) 100vw, 643px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>1. Fair Trade<\/h2>\n<p>It is not easy to repair the old and broken house, but it is much easier to build a new one. The same with placing the brand on the market. Members of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fairtradecertified.org\/join-the-community\">fair trade community<\/a> stand for the payment of higher prices to exporters, as well as improved environmental and social standards. To achieve good results, entrepreneurs have to learn about building a good foundation for their businesses, so their products will continue to stand still on the marketplace.<\/p>\n<p>What about transparency in this case? The main thing for a brand is to impress customers; they should remember your product after. A good reputation is like strong material for the house. While business founders stick to the fair trade methods from the beginning of their brands, they have more chances to resist the pressure of competitors.<\/p>\n<p>As an example of fair trading, Patagonia company is known worldwide by its overall reducing impact on the environment while creating clothes. They are taking responsibility for themselves to improve the manufacturing process with less harmful and eco-friendly methods.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Reality Matches Expectations<\/h2>\n<p>You could advertise your brand and present it to the audience as the most transparent brand in the world, but one mistake may kill a customer\u2019s trust in you. The reason is mismatches between a customer\u2019s expectations about the product and its features reality.<\/p>\n<p>There are a lot of scandals around the biggest popular eastern marketplaces online concerning clothes, that look much better on photos than on receivers. Why does it happen so? The answer is simple: customers want to know exactly what they buy. They are ready to look for information on the internet, read reviews, and compare with the <a href=\"https:\/\/library.cityu.edu\/howto\/school-of-management\/find-a-companys-competitors\/\">company\u2019s competitors<\/a>. Therefore, all information should be truthful.<\/p>\n<p>When consumers believe brand from the first purchase, it turns to long-term friendship, which is profitable for one and another side of the deal.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Comfort For Everybody<\/h2>\n<p>When a brand\u2019s policy includes a transparent path, founders might care about it on all steps of the producing process. Comfort means not only for customers and companies by increased income. It means <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wbdg.org\/design-objectives\/productive\/provide-comfortable-environments\">comfort for the environment<\/a> as well.<\/p>\n<p>Consumers\u2019 world is changing fast. Everybody lives through a period of significant social, political, technological, and ecological disruption. We\u2019re looking for companies we may trust from this moment and in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Nine countries and over 100 U.S. cities or counties have banned or restricted foam packaging. Fifteen significant brands, including Dow Chemical, Coca-Cola Co, L\u2019Oreal, Danone, Marks &amp; Spencer, Procter &amp; Gamble, Mars, Unilever, and PepsiCo, recommended replacement of polystyrene foam as a packaging material in the released report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in 2017.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Attention to Customer\u2019s Needs<\/h2>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mcdonalds.com\/us\/en-us.html\">McDonald\u2019s<\/a> isn\u2019t a healthy food choice. This fact is known for customers, but they still want the facts to make conscious decisions in their nutrition. On October 25, 2005, at the conference in Chicago company decided to print nutrition information on every product\u2019s package. This information makes people weigh the positive and negative impact of fast food on their health, count calories, and reduce times of having a full meal.<\/p>\n<p>One more good example, McDonald\u2019s gives on marketing steps about attentiveness to their customers. This situation happened in 1990<sup>th<\/sup> when a young schoolboy said to one of the McDonalds\u2019 workers: \u201cMister, stop being so mean and give me my sandwich wrapped in paper.\u201d Until this year, the biggest fast-food company was packing sandwiches in Styrofoam, and on November 1, 1990, McDonald\u2019s decided to eliminate this material from usage.<\/p>\n<p>Even though the company didn\u2019t give credit to proactive kids, who shared this idea with them, they did a big step to the environment\u2019s future.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Value of Internal Content<\/h2>\n<p>The higher the importance of packaging products for modern companies, the less attention they pay to the content. We figured out what is best for the environment, so it should be healthier for consumers from all sides. Let\u2019s discover some examples.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lushusa.com\/\">Lush<\/a> is a popular organic cosmetic by its policy of non-testing on animals. Their values are in products made from fresh organic fruits and vegetables, the finest and meticulously selected essential oils and safe synthetic ingredients.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.marksandspencer.com\/\">Marks&amp;Spencer<\/a> is a popular multi-brand that specializes in clothing, home decor, food, energetical, and financial programs. Since 2008<sup>th<\/sup> they have reduced carrier bag usage by 90%, recycled nearly 33 million used clothes, and decided to become zero waste business by 2025. As an example, M&amp;S made new swimwear from 100% recycled plastic bottles and used the polyester yarn in its production.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www2.hm.com\/en_us\/index.html\">H&amp;M<\/a> one more famous example of sustainability. High quality clothing is not the only concept of this group of companies. The global brand took leadership in recycling second-use clothing, producing clothes and accessorize\u2019s elements from waste as citrus fiber and banana fiber, and Take Care concept.<\/p>\n<p>When a product on itself becomes valuable not only for consumers but for suppliers as well, there are no GMO in their relations.<\/p>\n<p>Internal content is symbolic because the success of the company begins from the relations between superiors and employees as well. Every part of the machine should work correctly doesn\u2019t matter if it is wheels or engine.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Transparency would be the right decision in future processes; even the success of the brand had been reached at any cost. If a brand learns from its mistakes and shares its performance to people, it gives reason to trust it.<\/p>\n<p>Modern brands are more open-minded with customers, employees, the general public, and shareholders. This leads businesses to build trust while also taking responsibility for themselves. Companies of all sizes may use these same methods to improve their own internal policies, which will improve both customer satisfaction and employee morale.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the author<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hello!
