Within several hours, her video went viral and reached almost 70 million views.<\/p>\n<p>Three years later, in one of her videos, Jenna looked back at her viral success that jump-started her career, helped her get acting roles, her show on the radio, and made her a household name, and the queen of YouTube.<\/p>\n<p>The thing that, in her opinion, made this success, was going against the trend of looking spotless that was especially domineering at that time, and appealing to a certain emotion.<\/p>\n<p>These two aspects partly describe the characteristics of a viral message, the main tool in viral marketing.<\/p>\n<h2>The State of the Viral Marketing Today<\/h2>\n<p>With the rapid growth of the influence of social media platforms, viral, or word-of-mouth marketing, has gained popularity.<\/p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartinsights.com\/online-pr\/viral-marketing\/\">statistics<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>54% of people name viral marketing as the main driving force in helping them make purchase decisions<\/li>\n<li>49% of people believe that online viral messages are highly credible<\/li>\n<li>66% of respondents also think that viral marketing efforts of a brand can be very helpful<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you have the following of several millions of people, you may think that any post has the potential to go viral.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, not every message has the necessary characteristics.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/make-a-viral-post-with-jarvee\/\">what you need to know about a viral post<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Universal appeal<\/strong>. Everyone can relate to a viral message. That\u2019s what happened with Jenna\u2019s above-mentioned viral video \u2013 she addressed the situation that all of us have been it \u2013 self-criticism \u2013 but in a very humorous way.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Laconism<\/strong>. A viral message is brief and concise. Because it is usually short, it can be hard to choose the right words that will appeal to the necessary emotion.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Call-to-action. <\/strong>The viral message is created with a specific purpose \u2013 to inspire people to share the message as quickly as possible.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As a result, before creating viral content, a brand should be well-aware of the factors that support viral content and push it forward to outcompete other content online.<\/p>\n<p>What are these factors?<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look.<\/p>\n<h2> Finding the Right Fit<\/h2>\n<p>Many brands make a common mistake of targeting all social media platforms in order to achieve viral success.<\/p>\n<p>In reality, however, viral messages don\u2019t necessarily target all audiences, and not all content is necessarily a good fit for all social media platforms.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, before you launch your viral marketing campaign, determine, which social media platform fits best. You can do it by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Taking a look at the gender\/age distribution <\/strong>of a certain social media platform<strong>. <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For instance, on Twitter, the male audience dominates over the female audience (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/828092\/distribution-of-users-on-twitter-worldwide-gender\/\">69% and 31% respectively<\/a>), with several age groups being the most active on this platform:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Taking-a-look-at-the-gender-and-age-distribution-of-a-certain-social-media-platform.png\" alt=\"Taking a look at the gender and age distribution of a certain social media platform\" width=\"558\" height=\"346\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5442\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Taking-a-look-at-the-gender-and-age-distribution-of-a-certain-social-media-platform.png 558w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Taking-a-look-at-the-gender-and-age-distribution-of-a-certain-social-media-platform-300x186.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px\" \/><center>Image credit: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/283119\/age-distribution-of-global-twitter-users\/\">Statista<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Analyzing your own audience on social media. <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Who do you want to target? Is your target audience persona for your viral marketing campaign in line with your existing audience on a certain platform?<\/p>\n<p>You can answer these questions by going to the Analytics bar on a social media platform. On Facebook, for instance, you can see all the information on gender, age, location, language, and activity time:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Analyzing-your-own-audience-on-social-media.png\" alt=\"Analyzing your own audience on social media\" width=\"624\" height=\"177\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5446\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Analyzing-your-own-audience-on-social-media.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Analyzing-your-own-audience-on-social-media-300x85.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Analyzing-your-own-audience-on-social-media-600x170.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Social media analytics tools can also help you determine the best content type for a marketing campaign, <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/jarvee-social-media-scheduler-features\/\">schedule your posts<\/a>, and measure metrics and statistics.<\/p>\n<h2> Hashtag It! <\/h2>\n<p>Though it may look small and unnecessary, a hashtag is actually a very potent tool to give a push to your viral marketing campaign.<\/p>\n<p>The right use of hashtags has helped many startups to stand out and obtain viral success. For instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/hu.flatfy.com\/\">Flatfy<\/a>, once a real estate startup, and now \u2013 a successful international company, jump-started their online success with a hashtag #bootstrap, which, at that time, had a great online performance:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/a-hashtag-is-actually-a-very-potent-tool.png\" alt=\"a hashtag is actually a very potent tool \" width=\"582\" height=\"183\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5447\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/a-hashtag-is-actually-a-very-potent-tool.png 582w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/a-hashtag-is-actually-a-very-potent-tool-300x94.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px\" \/><center>Image credit: <a href=\"https:\/\/hashtagify.me\/hashtag\/bootstrap\">Hashtagify.me<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n<p>On Twitter, the list of top hashtags is updated every day. These hashtags are the routes to the viral content that\u2019s shared the most during a certain day. Watching the hashtags will help you get on board of current trends and will increase the chances of your content obtaining viral success.<\/p>\n<h2> Reward Your Audience<\/h2>\n<p>One of the most important characteristics of a viral message is that it should bring value to the audience that will spread this message further.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, to increase the chances that the target audience will share your viral content is having them participate in creating this viral content, and reward them for their contribution.<\/p>\n<p>This is exactly what Starbucks did in 2014 with their <a href=\"https:\/\/stories.starbucks.com\/stories\/2014\/starbucks-invites-you-to-decorate-its-iconic-white-cup\/\">#WhiteCupChallenge<\/a>. They invited all their fans to come up with creative designs for their white cup and then share their ideas on social media.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the challenge, Starbucks picked the winner out of millions of social media posts, helping the woman that won this challenge start her career in design:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/a-viral-message-should-bring-value-to-the-audience.jpg\" alt=\"a viral message should bring value to the audience\" width=\"624\" height=\"290\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5448\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/a-viral-message-should-bring-value-to-the-audience.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/a-viral-message-should-bring-value-to-the-audience-300x139.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/a-viral-message-should-bring-value-to-the-audience-600x279.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><center>Image credit: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BuVKxHzHusO\/\">Instagram<\/a><\/center><\/p>\n<p>User-generated content has the best performance, when it comes to viral marketing, as people are more interested in sharing their own experiences with others. The formula is simple: your users help you go viral, and you reward them in return.<\/p>\n<h2>Wrapping It Up<\/h2>\n<p>We covered many examples of viral success in this article, but they share one thing.<\/p>\n<p>They\u2019re not intrusive.<\/p>\n<p>The worst idea about a viral message is that it has to be intrusive. In reality, however, it shouldn\u2019t provoke repulsion, but should rather appeal to positive emotions.<\/p>\n<p>Remembering this together with our tips will help you understand viral marketing better and create content that will help you obtain viral success.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the author<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ryan is a passionate writer who likes sharing his thoughts and experience with the readers.
