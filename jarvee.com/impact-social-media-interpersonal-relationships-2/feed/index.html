					<description><![CDATA[Just read your article! Thank you....Very informative &#038; interesting. I forwarded it to quite a few people.  It&#039;s very disconcerting to take a look around while in public places and see how many people are engrossed in their phones instead of interacting with each other.  Especially family and friends who are sitting with each other. Good luck to you in your future endeavors!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve recently decided to close all my private social media profiles since I noticed that I don&#039;t interact with friends and family as much as I did before. However, I&#039;d never recommend that to my customers :D]]></description>
