You could be actually really good at what you do but without the right approach to your potential clients, you could be stagnating instead of growing your business and getting new clients.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/what-is-referral-marketing-examples-and-strategies\/\">Referrals<\/a> are an awesome award when you have satisfied clients, but relying on referrals only will not get you far.<\/p>\n<p>The best way to find out what works best for your niche is to test different strategies and see what will give you the best results. The optimal solution that will work for everyone does not exist, but there are obvious differences between a well-thought-out approach and something that just looks like a generic spam message.<\/p>\n<p>Most of those that offer Instagram account management services through DM have a generic approach businesses on Instagram see often.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/sales\/b2b-outreach-strategy-for-startups\">outreach approach<\/a> that we will share with you is something that will say to your potential client that you are an expert in this area and that you know something he wasn\u2019t even aware of &#8211; and that can give him better results. As a bonus, the user will see that you are actually ready to go the extra mile to understand his needs.<\/p>\n<h1>Recommended starting point<\/h1>\n<p>There are some fundamental elements that you should work on if you want to have a decent trust score when potential clients visit your profile to create their impression of you.<\/p>\n<p>The profile that you will use to contact users needs to look professional and trustworthy. It should have a strong bio, relevant and valuable content, and transparent contact details.<\/p>\n<p>As an addition, it would be great if you would have some examples of your previous work and satisfied clients. Even if you don\u2019t have this and just respect what\u2019s mentioned in the previous paragraph, you will be one step ahead of your competition.<\/p>\n<p>At this point, you should already have chosen <a href=\"https:\/\/trendhero.io\/blog\/instagram-niches\/\">the niche of clients<\/a> to which you offer your services. If you are still not sure about it or you are wandering through different niches and doing a bit of everything, just stop here and invest some time to decide on your niche. Choose something that comes under your area of interest and something that you have knowledge of. This way you will have more chances to gain and retain the client since you will be able to understand his business and that\u2019s something that is highly appreciated.<\/p>\n<h1><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8939 \" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/trust-1024x658.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"803\" height=\"516\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/trust-1024x658.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/trust-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/trust-768x494.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/trust-600x386.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/trust-1536x987.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/trust-2048x1317.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px\" \/><\/h1>\n<h1>Where to start with the process<\/h1>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>Create a presentation of your services &#8211; short and sweet<\/h2>\n<p>Good preparation and presentation of your services are taking you one step closer to getting that new client. Prepare a simple and well-structured presentation of your services that you will have ready when you come to that point in the conversation to understand which of your services could solve your client\u2019s problems and help him with something he is struggling with. It would be convenient to have your proposal created as an image as well, since this way it will be easier for the user to read it. When you leave an impression of an organized person with a clear vision, they will have less fear to put their business into your hands.<\/p>\n<p>There is a golden rule you will hear from many successful sale experts, you should <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/georgebradt\/2017\/08\/15\/why-you-should-under-promise-and-over-deliver-but-not-by-too-much\/?sh=5984e8c04928\">underpromise and overdeliver<\/a> on results. Don\u2019t promise something you can\u2019t deliver. This way you will lose the client fast since he will be disappointed. When you exceed expectations, not only that the client will be happy, but you can also expect word-of-mouth advertising and referrals.<\/p>\n<h2>Prepare a list of potential clients based on your niche<\/h2>\n<p>We already showed you how you can easily <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-to-find-clients-that-will-pay-you-to-manage-their-instagram-accounts\/\">extract users from your niche<\/a> in just a few steps. With this method, you will have a bunch of potential clients on your plate.<\/p>\n<h2>Awareness<\/h2>\n<p>Now when you have that list of users that could potentially be interested in your services, you should first start slowly following them. You can also<a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/knowledge-base\/instagram-follow-tool\/\"> follow users automatically<\/a> with Jarvee. After that, give them some additional social signals, like some posts or comment on some of their posts. This way you will get noticed by them and at the point you contact them, they will have in mind that your profile is familiar to them.<\/p>\n<h2>DM after few days<\/h2>\n<p>Now when you sent some social signals, it\u2019s time to send them the first message. You should save as much time as possible and be efficient and effective with the process, and still not lose on the outreach strategy.<\/p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/knowledge-base\/instagram-contact-tool\/\">Instagram Contact tool<\/a> you can easily automate sending messages to the list of users you have. This way you can invest more time in other activities that will help you to grow your business.<\/p>\n<p>The idea is to create a personalized, but a bit casual message at the same time, something like the example below.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<em>Hi [user\u2019s name]! I noticed that there is a lot of unused potential on your account. I believe that it drives you crazy that the content you created doesn\u2019t get the reach you expected. I know this as I grow IG brands for your niche and I see the space for growth.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>With knowledge about IG algorithm and tactics that work, I can help you to get followers from your location, that could become your paying customers. I would be happy to give you a free consultation and some tips you can use to optimize your profile. Do you have a few minutes to chat here?<\/em>&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>IG doesn\u2019t like when you send the same message to many users, so you can use the spinning syntax feature within Jarvee Contact tool, a feature that can help you to automatically create more message scenarios and send different messages to different users.<\/p>\n<p>If you get a positive response from the client that he is willing to chat to hear what you have to say, it\u2019s your time to shine! Check his profile and see what are the basic things you can recommend him to adjust and give him some free value. These are the first steps to creating a trusting relationship with the client.<\/p>\n<p>If he doesn\u2019t reply, you can take advantage of one more awesome Jarvee option and send him a <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/knowledge-base\/how-sending-secondary-messages-work\/\">secondary message<\/a> automatically. But make sure to check the option to send a secondary message only if the user has not replied.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some examples of the things you can check to provide free value:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>optimize bio<\/li>\n<li>optimize username for search<\/li>\n<li>use hashtags\/or use niche relevant hashtags<\/li>\n<li>consistency with posting &#8211; time, number of posts per week<\/li>\n<li>adding location to posts<\/li>\n<li>branding his content<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When the conversation continues, try to understand what issues he has and show him that you understand his needs based on your experience. Then wait for the moment to ask him if he is willing to grow his business and if he has space to get more clients. When he replies with yes, then it\u2019s time to send him an offer that you previously created and close the deal.<\/p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>There are different methods you can use when reaching potential clients, this is just one of them. Try and adjust your methods according to your niche and your personal aspirations. Something that works for you may not work for others. But the general picture is that people appreciate a personalized approach, with appreciation and respect and those should be the main ingredients of your strategy. Work smart and save time with the process where you can.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Gaining new clients can be a really hard task, especially if you don\u2019t know even how to start.
