You can get a rough idea of how many websites have the same niche and blogs as you.s<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, a writer may do duplication in his work unintentionally without noticing this problem.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we are going to show you what plagiarism is and how it will affect your website\u2019s writing.<\/p>\n<h2>What is Plagiarism?<\/h2>\n<p>If you have been working as an online writer for months or years, you have heard about this terminology many times.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/topics\/social-sciences\/plagiarism\">Plagiarism<\/a> means duplication of other\u2019s writing and publishes it as your own. It may be a word-to-word duplication or partial duplication of other authors on the internet.<\/p>\n<p>There are multiple types of plagiarism that a writer must know about to make his work unique, engaging, and appealing.<\/p>\n<p>If a writer is doing duplication of others intentionally or in senses, then there is no way to avoid it. The reason is that he won\u2019t be able to write without copying something from a website.<\/p>\n<p>But it is not compulsory that a writer is doing this activity with full attention. Someone who may have written on the same topic with the same point of view can also cause duplication.<\/p>\n<p>In such a case, a writer may write a blog and found it duplicated at the end of his work. If you are suffering from such a situation, you can reduce this problem easily by following few steps.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s have a look at those steps that you should keep in mind while looking to remove plagiarism.<\/p>\n<h2>Checking plagiarism<\/h2>\n<p>Once you have written a blog or article for your website, you should analyze it thoroughly.<\/p>\n<p>Here we don\u2019t mean to proofread your document only but to check whether you have written unique or not.<\/p>\n<p>It is impossible to check billions of web pages and read them to check for duplication. When a tool can do this task effectively then why you have to mess your head with this task.<\/p>\n<p>There are multiple tools available over the internet that you can use for this analysis. You only have to pick the right tool to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prepostseo.com\/plagiarism-checker\">check plagiarism<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/plagiarism-checker-1024x756.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"802\" height=\"592\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The tool will enable you to compare your work with all the published web pages, documents, books, journals, and all other papers.<\/p>\n<p>In this way, it will enable you to do the task within few minutes that a person can\u2019t do manually. The tool will show exact matches of your work that it has found over the internet.<\/p>\n<p>By getting this result, you will be able to remove plagiarism from your work and make it unique. You can use synonyms and related phrases for this task to make your work unique.<\/p>\n<p>Now, you have got enough knowledge about how to remove plagiarism from your writings.<\/p>\n<p>The next section will show why you have to do this and what will be the impact of plagiarism on SERP results.<\/p>\n<h2>How does plagiarism affect SERPs ranking?<\/h2>\n<p>SERP or search engine result pages are those web pages that you will get while searching for any query.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone wants to get his website on the top positions of SERPs to get better outcomes and prominent profit.<\/p>\n<p>It is not a surprising fact that plagiarism will affect your website\u2019s performance directly or indirectly.<\/p>\n<p>To understand how it happens, we have to take a look at those factors that Google analyzes while <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-to-boost-website-organic-traffic-and-drive-more-revenue\/\">ranking a website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>There are more than 200 factors that <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/google-ranking-factors\">Google analyzes<\/a> to give a specific position to any website. The most important among all of those factors is the content that you are publishing on your website.<\/p>\n<p>Your website will never rank higher on SERPs if it has duplicated content. Here are few problems that you might have to face while doing duplication on your website.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Google Penalties<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>No doubt, a man can\u2019t catch duplicated content but Google can do this task within seconds. When Google found you guilty of stealing someone\u2019s work, it will give you a notice.<\/p>\n<p>It will never ask you to pay a particular amount as a fine. But it will start penalizing your website differently. In turn, you will start getting penalties from Google for copying others.<\/p>\n<p>When a website got a penalty from a search engine, it is impossible to get ranked in the same position again.<\/p>\n<p>So, you should avoid penalties by Google by using unique content on your website.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>DMCA copyright strike<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Whether you are copying others intentionally or unintentionally, you may have to experience this problem.<\/p>\n<p>When a webmaster found his content on another website, he will immediately take action.<\/p>\n<p>He might send you a notice according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.copyright.gov\/dmca\/\">DMCA<\/a> law by United States government for reducing digital theft.<\/p>\n<p>In this case, a search engine has the authority to remove your website from its database or the entire search engine.<\/p>\n<p>It is the most threatening factor for a website to become invisible from search queries of its audience.<\/p>\n<p>In turn, your website may get banned temporarily or permanently from search engines. With this, all your investment will go in vain and you won\u2019t be able to get a little advantage from your hard work.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Brand\u2019s Reputation<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>No matter if you have a general website or a brand representing a store, if you are using plagiarized content, you will get the worst results from this unethical action.<\/p>\n<p>This factor comes mostly in the field when you are doing self-plagiarism instead of unintentional one. The reason is that when visitors keep reading the same content, they will get bored.<\/p>\n<p>In turn, they will leave your platform and contact any other for their purchase.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, if you have copied something from a well-reputed brand, then it will also leave a bad impact on the user.<\/p>\n<p>In short, plagiarized content is harmful to your brand\u2019s reputation and will never let you experience better performance.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Never rank duplicated websites<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Google or any other search engine hates duplication in content no matter which field you belong to. Any search engine does not consider whether you are copying someone or they are copying you.<\/p>\n<p>When it found similar work on any of two or more websites, it gets confused that which website has original content.<\/p>\n<p>In turn, it will de-rank both of these websites and push some other websites on their positions.<\/p>\n<p>So, if you are sure that your website content is unique, you should keep a check on it.<\/p>\n<p>For this task, you can buy a tool that will keep tracking your content and inform you if someone has copied it.<\/p>\n<p>In this way, you will get notified whenever any other webmaster or blogger has used your work as his original work.<\/p>\n<p>With this step, you can easily take DMCA notice against him and ask him to remove that copied part.<\/p>\n<p>By doing this, you will be able to save your rank and keep your position stable in a search engine.<\/p>\n<h2>Wrapping Up<\/h2>\n<p>With the above discussion, you are quite clear how can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vyasinfotech.com\/2021\/05\/how-plagiarized-blog-post-is-harmful.html\">plagiarized content<\/a> create troubles to rank in SERPs. We recommend you check plagiarism and remove this factor from your work on a priority basis.<\/p>\n<p>Otherwise, it may harm your website a lot and keep you lower in SERPs. In some specific conditions, you will never be able to rank on possible reached results of any search engine.<\/p>\n<h2>Author&#8217;s Bio<\/h2>\n<p>Talha Nasir writes SEO articles for online business marketers and SEO tools users to make their Google rankings surge.
