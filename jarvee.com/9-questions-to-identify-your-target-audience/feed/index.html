					<description><![CDATA[A good way to identify your optimal audience is to check who is currently using your products or services or who is interested. When you know who is already interested in your niche, you should check on your competition as well. This way you can check if they are covering some part of the audience that you haven&#039;t consider.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Tip 7 really helps simplify things. Because then you don&#039;t have to apply the same tactics you&#039;re applying to your prospects. The dynamics of the buyer mindset and a prospects mindset are quite different and should be treated as that in my opinion. So if you know whether someone has bought your product or not, you can sell another product with ease, where as if you didn&#039;t differentiate, you&#039;d probably be wasting money.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Some people create products that have a broad use. although it may seem like something great, however, it can result in a disaster. I believe one should create a product in a very specific niche and then broaden its usability within that specific community.
