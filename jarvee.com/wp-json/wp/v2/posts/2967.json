all through one, user-friendly interface.<\/p>\n<p><strong>By automating social media tasks you&#8217;ll free up more time to focus on:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Engaging your Audience<\/strong> &#8211; Manually keeping track of content feedback from your audience can be challenging.\u00a0 By using social media automation, you&#8217;ll be notified of responses, queries, messages, and comments received in an interface that&#8217;s easy to navigate and understand.\u00a0 Rather than spending time manually checking for responses, you can now spend that time curating helpful responses to your audience.<\/p>\n<p>In return, you&#8217;ll provide more insightful feedback, your audience receives better help, and everyone benefits.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Curating Engaging Content<\/strong> &#8211; Content marketing is where most businesses fall short.\u00a0 Business owners, brands, entrepreneurs &#8211; time isn&#8217;t always on our side and we may be rushed to curate, edit, and publish content for our audience.\u00a0 Unfortunately, you can&#8217;t rush art, and, you can&#8217;t rush content quality.\u00a0 Sharing content manually across multiple social sites can consume precious time out of your schedule.<\/p>\n<p>As discussed in <a href=\"https:\/\/mashable.com\/2014\/08\/28\/social-marketing-sins\/#Girp2_LgCGqn\">a report<\/a> on <strong>what mistakes to avoid<\/strong> in Social Media: all social media platforms should be treated and posted to equally.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than investing your time in the process of publishing, automate the publication process so more time can be spent on producing the content quality that your audience has come to expect.<\/p>\n<p>In Jarvee, ensuring that your content reaches all of your channels is as simple as adding in your account credentials.\u00a0 It couldn&#8217;t be easier and you&#8217;ll save yourself a TON of time and effort.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Brand Messaging <\/strong>&#8211; Distributing your content across multiple social media accounts is a lot of work and you want to make sure your content reaches all channels.\u00a0 By manually managing the publishing of your content on so many accounts it can be easy to glance over and forget about getting your content published for the day on a particular account.<\/p>\n<p>Aside from the time you&#8217;ll save &#8211; automating your social media marketing will permit you to have your content evenly distributed across all of your chosen networks automatically with no chance of anything being missed.<\/p>\n<p>I absolutely love the intuitive user interface that Jarvee provides as I can easily monitor my branding efforts across all of my social media accounts and can ensure that scheduling for posts are published as they should.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Understand your Businesses Position on Social Media<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2971\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/understand-your-business-position-on-social-media.jpg\" alt=\"understand your business position on social media\" width=\"481\" height=\"330\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/understand-your-business-position-on-social-media.jpg 481w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/understand-your-business-position-on-social-media-300x206.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px\" \/>Some companies spend thousands of dollars on generating data reports and statistic overviews and needless to say \u2013 such a process is costly and time consuming.\u00a0 By automating social media, you\u2019ll be able to view all of your accounts from an easy-to-use interface that will display account follower count, mentions, shares, and much more data that is extremely useful for you.<\/p>\n<p>Before the practice of automating tasks \u2013 manually reviewing each account to understand growth and brand reach was a part of all businesses daily routine.\u00a0 However, you can alleviate yourself of having to manually check each of your accounts by accepting the social media automation concept to help you save time while giving you a better idea of where you stand.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Set and Forget \u2013 Manage Account Actions with Ease<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no debate to be had when I say that saving time is the biggest benefit to automating social media marketing efforts.\u00a0 Let&#8217;s take for example an Instagram page that I have for one of my 3 brands.\u00a0 Initially, I spent about a couple hours per day on this account alone.\u00a0 I spent precious time uploading photos, responding to comments, following others, and answering DM&#8217;s.<\/p>\n<p>Now, if we take a look at the Instagram tool provided by Jarvee (which I&#8217;m currently using) &#8211; I have access to automation features that include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Post Scheduling<\/li>\n<li>Auto Re-post<\/li>\n<li>Auto-Follow<\/li>\n<li>Follow-Back<\/li>\n<li>Unfollow<\/li>\n<li>Auto-Like<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In addition to 15 other functionality options that they offer.<\/p>\n<p>Just by automating the 6 tasks listed above, I was able to accomplish quite a few things including saving time, growing my brand through following others automatically, and uploading\/reposting content (scheduled).<\/p>\n<p>This has afforded me the opportunity to work on offline marketing which has driven my business new clients and sales that I otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had without the use of social media automation.<\/p>\n<p>What are you waiting for?\u00a0 If you\u2019re like me and want to utilize your time more effectively, consider automating your social media activity so that your time can be spent on growing your business rather than maintaining it.<\/p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2974\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/elias-arosemena-guest-author-2.jpg\" alt=\"elias arosemena guest author \" width=\"109\" height=\"100\" \/>Elias Arosemena<\/strong> is a startup advisor, social media aficionado, and SEO consultant.
