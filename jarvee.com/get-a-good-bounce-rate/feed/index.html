Thanks for your remarks Akbar, we highly appreciate that. 

Good question, however, that will depend on the video itself. If it is annoying people will leave, if it&#039;s not, they will stick. 

However, as a good rule of thumb, it&#039;s best to avoid such content.]]></description>

Good question! 

Yes indeed, to be more precise, the state of mind is what effects bounce rate. Because of that, different timings very well can affect bounce rate.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the great article Jarvee, I always learn a thing or two whenever i read your articles. 

I have a question if you don&#039;t mind me asking..

You guys mention how we shouldn&#039;t include auto-play videos to avoid a bad page load speed. However, wouldn&#039;t an auto-play video decrease the bounce rate since more people will automatically start watching the video?]]></description>
