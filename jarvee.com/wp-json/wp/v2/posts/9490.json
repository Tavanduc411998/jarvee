Anyone who\u2019s been in the SEO field for some time will have pages in need of improvement or just don\u2019t seem to engage the reader or attract the attention of Google crawlers. There are many possibilities why a page doesn\u2019t achieve the expected results or struggles to retain its position. One of the primary reasons lies in the content and we will share with you the no-fail secrets to creating Epic and SEO-friendly content.<\/p>\n<p>Back in the dark ages of the Internet, all a site would need to do is stuff a page full of keywords, throw up a link farm, and a lot of annoying pop-ups, and voila, you\u2019re getting noticed. But Google has changed the game \u2013 always updating its algorithms to ensure Netizens get quality and relevant search results have put the old ways into the dustbin of history. Writing a good copy isn\u2019t easy, but with a little dedication and elbow grease, you\u2019ll be on your way to climbing the ladder on the SERP.<\/p>\n<h2>The first step \u2013 use an analytical approach<\/h2>\n<p>Great content requires significant preparation, even if you\u2019re a subject matter expert on the topic, preparation is imperative to winning the favor of readers and the Google bots. Do your due diligence to understand your <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/top-10-expert-tips-on-researching-your-target-audience\/\">target audience<\/a> as well as your competitors. Invest significant time mining out data. The more you know about the target audience and the competition, the easier and more effective your content will be. An analytical approach to writing epic content includes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Build a buyer\u2019s persona \u2013 Speaking to your reader is a strategy much content lacks. When you speak to the reader, you are establishing a direct relationship between your solutions and their needs. Therefore, identify who you are writing for and any demographic information that matches the reader to products. Establish any pain points customers may have and how you can solve them. This strategy will help you establish a voice.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Have a good set of tools \u2013 The most effective way to gather data is having a platform of professional tools at your disposal that can guide your strategy. While many tools exist on the market, be sure your choice at least includes: keyword search and ranking, full site audits, competitive advantage analysis, and backlink monitoring.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Snoop on your competitors \u2013 Start by reviewing their site and how they target their content. Are there any reviews or other forms of feedback you can dig into? Using your SEO tools you can get a good grasp of where they are focusing on and areas they neglect via analyzing keywords. Having established an understanding of their strategies<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Plan around technical aspects<\/h2>\n<p>An outline is critical for organizing your data and delivering compelling ideas. Review your notes from your competitor analysis as well as any other technical data you\u2019ve gathered from your SEO tools such as <a href=\"https:\/\/seranking.com\/\">SE Ranking<\/a>. With this data, you\u2019ll be able to draft your outline which will help focus your text and guide the reader to the information they need.<\/p>\n<p>This is best accomplished by dividing content into functional paragraphs to include these elements as value-added content. Build a structure around key phrases to structure your H2s which is where you\u2019ll organically place keywords and links that fit naturally without disrupting the flow of the text or appear awkward. Now it\u2019s time to get down to writing.<\/p>\n<h2>Speak to your audience<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9508 \" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/target-audience-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"801\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/target-audience-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/target-audience-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/target-audience-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/target-audience-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/target-audience-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/target-audience-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 801px) 100vw, 801px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Often, content comes across as too flat or complicated. A true wordsmith knows how to say more with less. The goal here is to not get bogged down with technical requirements, and remember the text should speak to the reader and provide the information they are looking for. Remember to speak to your audience. Sprinkle in a few questions related to their concerns and then answer them. Great content serves the audience, and also be sure it\u2019s scannable.<\/p>\n<p>These tips will increase your content quality:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Follow a logical structure\u00a0 \u2013 Think of your text as a funnel, bring the reader through a journey starting with high-level ideas and flow into smaller details.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Break up large sections of text \u2013 Use your H2s to add scannability to your text. Also, add images and mix up the font. No matter how interesting your topic is, nobody wants to read a novel.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Simplify with Visuals \u2013 When delivering a diatribe of data, it\u2019s better to let graphs, charts, and tables do the talking.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now that we have a foundation for delivering a scannable text that flows with the audience, it\u2019s time to take a look at some writing mechanics.<\/p>\n<h2>Use Different Platforms<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9509 \" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/use-different-platforms-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"802\" height=\"535\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/use-different-platforms-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/use-different-platforms-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/use-different-platforms-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/use-different-platforms-600x400.jpg 600w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/use-different-platforms-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/use-different-platforms-2048x1365.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 802px) 100vw, 802px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Who says content must be blogs or landing pages?
