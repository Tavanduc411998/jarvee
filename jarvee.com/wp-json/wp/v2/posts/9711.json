To help your small business start using Instagram Stories, we&#8217;ve also gathered the list of Instagram Story ideas that work best for small businesses.<\/p>\n<h2>1.\u00a0\u00a0 Tell More About Your Small Business and Products<\/h2>\n<p>No matter how good your unique selling proposition is, it means nothing unless you have people who are interested in giving it a try. It&#8217;s nearly impossible to convince people to test your products when they don&#8217;t know about your company.<\/p>\n<p>The more people know about your small business, the more potential customers you can acquire. With ephemeral content, you can tell your viewers everything you want them to know about your small business and products without clogging the main feed up with content.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a shopping platform P.S. Styling has decided to repost press mentions to Instagram Stories. Not only does it provide viewers with information on the company&#8217;s products and services, but it also helps to increase brand trust as people pay close attention to brand endorsements.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9714\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Tell-More-About-Your-Small-Business-and-Products.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Tell-More-About-Your-Small-Business-and-Products.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Tell-More-About-Your-Small-Business-and-Products-300x178.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Tell-More-About-Your-Small-Business-and-Products-600x357.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Instagram Stories vanish within 24 hours, but you can make some of them live permanently on your profile if you use Instagram Story Highlights. Grouping relevant Stories in separate albums, you can help other Instagram users understand more about your small business when visiting your account as these albums appear right below the bio section.<\/p>\n<h2>2.\u00a0\u00a0 Humanize Your Brand with Behind the Scenes Content<\/h2>\n<p>With the great variety of nearly identical products, the modern market has become oversaturated which means selling to your customers is getting customers. People are spoiled with the array of products, so they pay close attention to brands they trust.<\/p>\n<p>The best way for small businesses to cut through the noise and increase brand trust is to humanize their brand. Today, customers seek out authentic behind-the-scenes content that makes them feel closer to the brand. With a short lifespan, Instagram Stories offer a great platform to show off your behind-the-scenes content.<\/p>\n<p>Behind-the-scenes content comes in various forms, whether you decide to introduce your team members, show a typical workday of your company, or tell more about the product creation process. To humanize your brand, you can post authentic content and save it as Story Highlights, just like in the example below:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9715\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Humanize-Your-Brand-with-Behind-the-Scenes-Content.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Humanize-Your-Brand-with-Behind-the-Scenes-Content.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Humanize-Your-Brand-with-Behind-the-Scenes-Content-300x144.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Humanize-Your-Brand-with-Behind-the-Scenes-Content-600x288.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>3.\u00a0\u00a0 Spark Interest in Your Product Variety<\/h2>\n<p>Having a product variety is a great marketing tactic that allows business owners to attract different customers with different needs and wants. Showing off your products in Instagram Stories is great, but you can also use some tricks to spark interest in your product variety.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the example below. The jewelry company made an <u><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-to-use-instagram-reels-to-increase-your-followers\/\">Instagram Reel<\/a><\/u> present its collection of products, reposted it to Instagram Stories, and added a special offer that could encourage viewers to buy several products and therefore get a discount.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9716\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Spark-Interest-in-Your-Product-Variety.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"314\" height=\"559\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Spark-Interest-in-Your-Product-Variety.png 314w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Spark-Interest-in-Your-Product-Variety-169x300.png 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you want to promote your products, not only should you post videos or photos of these products in Stories, but you should also make sure that your Stories look cohesive. The best way to do it is to use the same Instagram filters. According to <u><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.sellfy.com\/how-to-make-sell-lightroom-presets\/\">Sellfy<\/a><\/u>, using the same Instagram filters help to improve the look and feel of your Instagram Stories and make your content match your brand identity.<\/p>\n<h2>4.\u00a0\u00a0 Cause a Buzz Around Your Small Business<\/h2>\n<p>When you&#8217;re just starting on Instagram, it&#8217;s more likely that you don&#8217;t have many followers who might be interested in your Instagram Stories. First, it&#8217;s important to cause a buzz around your small business and there&#8217;s one proven way to use Instagram Stories for small business promotion that can result in <u><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/7-instagram-stories-ideas-to-get-more-followers\/\">more Instagram followers<\/a><\/u> or even potential customers&#8211;a collaboration with influencers.<\/p>\n<p>Modern customers trust recommendations from social media influencers, so they are more likely to become interested in your small business or your products after seeing them in Stories from favorite influencers.<\/p>\n<p>The easiest way to cause a buzz around your small business with influencer endorsements is to send your products to the right influencer for a product review.

Instagram Stories have the right features to start a conversation with your followers, ask them about their preferences, or even turn your followers into brand advocates. Moreover, people trust brands that listen to their feedback and implement it.<\/p>\n<p>To hook your followers&#8217; attention and understand your customers better, it&#8217;s important to encourage followers to join a conversation. For example, you can post several photos of your products, add a poll sticker, and invite your followers to vote for their choice. Or, you can include a question sticker that encourages users to leave their worries and concerns to explain everything they want to know about your business or get in touch to provide customer support.<\/p>\n<p>Another way to start a conversation with your followers via IG Stories is to repurpose FAQs that can ease the worried minds of potential customers and encourage other people to ask you questions about your business and products.

Before making a purchase, potential customers want to read customer stories as these reviews can help them understand whether your product is right for them. In other words, customers seek out social proof.<\/p>\n<p>To increase brand trust and turn more followers into customers, it&#8217;s a good idea to highlight your satisfied customers in Stories that can serve as social proof. For example, when someone writes a review on your product or takes a photo of themselves with a profile tag, you can repost these Stories to your account, just like in the example below:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9719\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Highlight-Your-Satisfied-Customers.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"309\" height=\"558\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Highlight-Your-Satisfied-Customers.png 309w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Highlight-Your-Satisfied-Customers-166x300.png 166w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>7.\u00a0\u00a0 Educate Followers on How to Use Your Products<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you sell products or services, it&#8217;s important to help your potential customers understand how your small business can solve their problems.
