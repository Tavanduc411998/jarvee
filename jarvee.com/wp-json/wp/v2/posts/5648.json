This will help you solidify your brand presence and build credibility, helping you connect with your target audience with ease.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most effective ways to <strong>remember <\/strong>to be active on LinkedIn is to download the mobile app and set aside 15-30 minutes every day to just post and engage with people on the platform. Set a reminder on your phone so you\u2019re able to make this is a daily practice.<\/p>\n<h2>Join and participate in LinkedIn groups<\/h2>\n<p>LinkedIn groups are a great place to meet like-minded people and connect with them.<\/p>\n<p>Find 3-4 relevant groups that are related to your niche and are frequented by your target audience. <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/3-reasons-why-you-should-join-linkedin-groups\/\">Join those groups<\/a> and make it a point to actively participate in them.<\/p>\n<p>Apart from posting content, you should also focus on answering questions and offer solutions (organically). However, don\u2019t make the mistake of being overly promotional and spam the group.<\/p>\n<p>The idea is to project yourself as an expert, so people are able to take note of you (and your business) and instill trust in you.<\/p>\n<p>All you have to do is insert the keywords related to your business\/industry and filter by \u2018Groups\u2019.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Join-and-participate-in-LinkedIn-groups.jpg\" alt=\"Join and participate in LinkedIn groups\" width=\"624\" height=\"485\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5650\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Join-and-participate-in-LinkedIn-groups.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Join-and-participate-in-LinkedIn-groups-300x233.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Join-and-participate-in-LinkedIn-groups-600x466.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Connect with potential leads<\/h2>\n<p>While you have your list of target companies and you can manually look for them, the smarter way to conduct your search and find new audiences is to leverage LinkedIn\u2019s Advanced Search feature.<\/p>\n<p>This useful feature lets you find the exact type of people you\u2019re looking for. You can filter as per location, industry, title, connections and groups.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you are part of an HR software company and want to reach out to the HR heads of small and mid-sized businesses. You insert the filters and narrow down on the best potential leads who you can write to.<\/p>\n<p>This saves time while enabling you to target specific people and strike conversations with those who have the power to take decisions.<\/p>\n<h2>Engage with personalized outreach <\/h2>\n<p>You send a connection request to a prospect. They accept it. The next thing you do is send them a message pushing your product.<\/p>\n<p><strong>No response.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s not surprising because why would a stranger (who knows nothing about you or your company) be compelled to reply to a salesy message.<\/p>\n<p>LinkedIn InMail\u2019s response rate is <a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/talent-solutions\/blog\/linkedin-best-practices\/2015\/9-stats-that-will-help-you-write-better-linkedin-inmails\">three times higher<\/a> than a regular email and sending promotional messages are just a waste of this opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>You need to play it tactfully.<\/p>\n<p>You first outreach message needs to be crisp. Start with introducing yourself, tailor the message to the prospect (you can complement them on their work, find a common ground or even mention an article they recently posted) and give them a reason to reply by asking a question.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re trying to highlight your product\/service, make sure you focus on how it\u2019s going to help them. The value proposition needs to be strong enough for them to consider your message and respond.<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at this outreach message. It provides value, offers social proof and ends with a clear call-to-action.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Engage-with-personalized-outreach.png\" alt=\"Engage with personalized outreach \" width=\"366\" height=\"269\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5651\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Engage-with-personalized-outreach.png 366w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Engage-with-personalized-outreach-300x220.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Leverage LinkedIn\u2019s paid tools<\/h2>\n<p>Apart from organically securing leads on LinkedIn, this platform also offers a range of <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/7-reasons-to-consider-paid-social-media-advertising\/\">advertising<\/a> products that will help you focus your targeting and reach the right leads.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the key ad formats you can leverage to run lead generating campaigns \u2013<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Lead Gen Forms<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This format lets you collect vital lead information without leaving LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<p>The user clicks on the lead gen form ad and is shown the lead form which comes with pre-filled details (picked from their profile).
