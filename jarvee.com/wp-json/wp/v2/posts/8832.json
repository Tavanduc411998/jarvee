You can diversify your employer branding strategy with photos, videos, Stories, Reels, and IGTV.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that, Instagram widely uses hashtags to categorize posts and make them more visible. You can even launch hashtag campaigns to get more attention to your employer brand.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, Instagram is perfect for the businesses aiming to hire younger generations \u2013 the largest group using this platform are Millennials and Gen Z-ers <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/325587\/instagram-global-age-group\/\">aged 18-34<\/a><\/u>.<\/p>\n<p>But what does it take to succeed on Instagram as an employer brand?<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few examples from the top companies.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Google \u2013 Short Interviews with Employees<\/h2>\n<p>Google is known for being a pioneer in many spheres of technology. But what you don\u2019t know is that its employer brand strategy on Instagram is as remarkable.<\/p>\n<p>On the Life at Google page, the brand turns its employees into <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.podium.com\/article\/instagram-influencers\/\">Instagram influencers<\/a><\/u>, showing their role in the company. Google\u2019s employees share photos of their home offices, corporate events, and educational programs.<\/p>\n<p>However, the format that flatters Google\u2019s employer brand the most is employee interviews, like this one with Elsa Berentzen-Ferguson, the company\u2019s Customer Success Manager:<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8841\" style=\"width: 634px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8841\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8841 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/lifeatgoogle.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/lifeatgoogle.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/lifeatgoogle-300x192.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/lifeatgoogle-600x385.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-8841\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>Credit: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CNF1oI9jPHq\/\">Life at Google<\/a><\/em><\/p><\/div>\n<p>This interview tells about Elsa\u2019s responsibilities and her role in Google\u2019s growth. She also uncovers a few perks of working for the company, which benefits its employer brand.<\/p>\n<h3>Can the employee interview format work for you as well?<\/h3>\n<p>Featuring employees on corporate social media channels is a part of employee advocacy\u2014a trend that has been gaining momentum in the past few years.<\/p>\n<p>Employee advocacy has a few significant perks:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Employees give an honest insider look at the company. <\/strong>Through an interview, you can ask your employees questions about the true experience of working for your company, providing an accurate image of it as an employer brand.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Staff\u2019s active involvement increases brand engagement. <\/strong>As advocates, your employees contribute their unique ideas to your employer&#8217;s brand strategy, making it more diverse.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Employee advocacy humanizes your employer brand. <\/strong>Showing real people who work for you makes your company appear more credible and trustworthy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Much like Google, you can also take advantage of employee interviews. For example, you can post interviews in Stories, go live on Instagram with your employees, or even film a video for IGTV.<\/p>\n<p>The critical point is to keep your interviews short and straightforward. During the interview, touch upon the central corporate values and how they help your employees grow as professionals. This way, you\u2019ll make a strong point for the benefit of your employer brand.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Salesforce \u2013 Promoting Open-Mindedness and Flexibility<\/h2>\n<p>With years, we see more and more employees getting tired of the traditional workplace dynamic, wanting more freedom. Reportedly, <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jasonwingard\/2020\/03\/06\/94-of-workers-want-this-benefit-and-most-leaders-are-screwing-it-up\/?sh=2ee7ac82451f\">94% of white-collar employees<\/a><\/u> say workplace flexibility is important to them\u2014it can help improve mental health and find work-life balance.<\/p>\n<p>Salesforce took advantage of this trend, highlighting open-mindedness and flexibility as the top corporate values on its Instagram page. Their company policies and the way the organization promotes them has earned Salesforce a rating of the best place to work for parents five years in a row:<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8844\" style=\"width: 634px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8844\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8844 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/salesforcejobs.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"272\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/salesforcejobs.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/salesforcejobs-300x131.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/salesforcejobs-600x262.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-8844\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Credit: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CITTpVnAgEi\/\">Salesforce Jobs<\/a><\/em><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/div>\n<h3>How does Salesforce show its support for parents?<\/h3>\n<p>It often features their employees\u2019 kids in Instagram posts, referring to them as Salesforce\u2019s future generation of trailblazers.

This can be a celebration of a national holiday, a closed event, workshops, lectures, conferences, or even a Zoom party.<\/p>\n<p>Also, to <u><a href=\"https:\/\/instasize.com\/blog\/5-tips-to-boost-your-instagram-exposure\">boost Instagram exposure<\/a><\/u> of your posts, you can take advantage of hashtags. At this point, make sure you choose top-performing hashtags that are currently trending on Instagram. But keep in mind that the hashtags should relate to the topic of your post.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Tek Systems\u2014Behind-the-Scenes Content<\/h2>\n<p>When evaluating companies as employers, potential job candidates are often interested in how life goes behind the scenes. Job applicants want to know what\u2019s in store for them, so uploading some BTS content could give them an idea of an employee\u2019s typical day at work.<\/p>\n<p>Tek Systems takes advantage of this approach to its full extent. The company\u2019s <u><a href=\"https:\/\/techwirehub.com\/best-instagram-marketing-strategies\/\">Instagram strategy<\/a><\/u> is filled with behind-the-scenes content featuring its staff, like this yoga session post:<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8845\" style=\"width: 634px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8845\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8845 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/tekcareers.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"275\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/tekcareers.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/tekcareers-300x132.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/tekcareers-600x264.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-8845\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B7RHuSCFKE8\/\">TekCareers<\/a><\/p><\/div>\n<p>Tek System\u2019s Instagram page also has behind-the-scenes IGTV videos, and product development sneak peeks. Before the pandemic, the company often posted pictures of its offices, which potential job applicants can find helpful.<\/p>\n<h3>What benefits does BTS content have for your employer brand?<\/h3>\n<p>Apart from giving a general insider look at the company, behind-the-scenes content has an array of benefits:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s another opportunity to showcase your team. <\/strong>You already know about the benefits of employee advocacy for employer brands. Behind-the-scenes content is one more opportunity to introduce your staff, just in a more natural and less staged way.<\/li>\n<li><strong>BTS content reflects the effort that goes into your product. <\/strong>We mentioned that you could use behind-the-scenes content to show the product development process. It\u2019s an opportunity to show job applicants what they\u2019re in for and also what you expect from them.<\/li>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s a chance to show the perks of working for your company. <\/strong>Fun events, corporate education, and professional development\u2014you can feature all these advantages in your BTS content to lure in top-notch candidates.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Making behind-the-scenes content a part of your <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-to-develop-instagram-marketing-strategies-to-boost-sales\/\">Instagram marketing<\/a> strategy makes a strong case for your employer brand. Keep in mind, though\u2014this content should be created naturally. Just show how much fun it is to work for you, and it will do the trick.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Microsoft\u2014Supporting Diversity<\/h2>\n<p>In recent years, diversity has been one of the hottest topics in HR and recruitment. Job candidates expect employers to create diverse workplaces to show their support of underrepresented minorities and their needs.<\/p>\n<p>Diversity can become one of the frontline topics in your employer&#8217;s brand strategy on Instagram. And there are many ways how you can show your support of diverse workplaces.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, Microsoft features its diverse employees in cooking videos, where they prepare their traditional dishes. The entire idea turned into something similar to an <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mediatraining.ltd.uk\/blogs\/influencer-marketing-strategies-for-your-social-media\">influencer marketing<\/a><\/u> campaign, but it\u2019s Microsoft employees who are giving tips and recommendations:<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8843\" style=\"width: 634px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8843\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8843 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/microsoftlife.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"313\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/microsoftlife.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/microsoftlife-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/microsoftlife-600x301.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-8843\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CLfCCstBwuB\/\">Microsoft Life<\/a><\/p><\/div>\n<p>There are also other posts featuring diverse employees from Microsoft locations around the world. It\u2019s a great way to show the company\u2019s support for different communities. And this approach works out well for Microsoft\u2019s employer brand.<\/p>\n<h3>What are other Instagram content ideas for supporting diversity?<\/h3>\n<p>The main goal is to show diversity through culture. For example, you can commemorate some traditional ethnic holidays on your Instagram page and mention how many employees of that ethnicity are a part of your team.<\/p>\n<p>If you would like to attract more diverse employees to your company, ask your team members to promote your employer brand through their Instagram accounts. This approach is similar to <u><a href=\"https:\/\/leadgenapp.io\/\">lead generation<\/a><\/u>, except your employees help attract potential job applicants from their communities instead.<\/p>\n<p>And, of course, it\u2019s always a great idea to show each employee\u2019s role in your company. This way, you recognize their contribution, which flatters you as an employer brand.<\/p>\n<h2>5. Marriott\u2014Highlighting the Importance of Social Issues<\/h2>\n<p>The support for social causes is a sign of an employer brand with high morals. Job candidates are often looking for companies where they can both work on exciting projects and increase their social impact.<\/p>\n<p>So, highlight your charitable activities in your employer brand strategy on Instagram to show which social issues your company is passionate about.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, Marriott manifests its support of sustainability by protecting turtle habitats and partnering with local fishermen around the world:<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8846\" style=\"width: 634px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8846\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8846 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/marriottcareers.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/marriottcareers.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/marriottcareers-300x139.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/marriottcareers-600x279.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-8846\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Credit: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CI5xaNgsYzA\/\">Marriott Careers<\/a><\/p><\/div>\n<p>Marriott\u2019s Instagram page also shows its employees participating in charity marathons and fundraising events. This way, the company recognizes that change is not possible without its staff\u2019s contribution.<\/p>\n<h3>How else can you highlight social issues to build up an employer brand?<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for potential job applicants who would share your passion for a particular social cause, you can pair your Instagram employer brand strategy with <u><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.appsumo.com\/tools-for-email-outreach\/\">email outreach<\/a><\/u>. For example, you can feature your Instagram post in a newsletter and let more people know about the charities you support.<\/p>\n<p>You can also ask your employees to share their favorite causes on your Instagram page. Google often practices this approach, giving its staff a platform to attract public attention to less popular social issues.<\/p>\n<p>Apart from that, launching an affiliate campaign, which you can manage through <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.idevdirect.com\/\">iDev Affiliate<\/a><\/u>, can help you raise funds for the social issues you are passionate about. Such a campaign will give you great publicity and contribute to your employer&#8217;s brand.<\/p>\n<h2>Invest in Your Employer Brand<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to bring more qualified candidates to your team, it will be pretty hard to achieve without a strong employer brand. We live in an age when everyone googles everyone. And it\u2019s nothing to be afraid of but rather to take advantage of.<\/p>\n<p>You can start building your employer brand on Instagram to show what it\u2019s like to work at your company. For instance, you can feature your employees who would tell about different workplace experiences and perks of working for you.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to attract the right candidates, it\u2019s always a great idea to create content representing your company\u2019s values, such as supporting diversity, flexibility, and different social issues.<\/p>\n<p>And, to show a more casual side of your company, you can have fun with behind-the-scenes content. As a result, you will create a well-rounded image of your employer on Instagram and get the attention of the best candidates on the market.<\/p>\n<h3>About the Author<\/h3>\n<p>Mariia Kovalenko is a content writer at <u><a href=\"https:\/\/digitalolympus.net\/\">Digital Olympus<\/a><\/u>.
