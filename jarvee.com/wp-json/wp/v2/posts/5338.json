That\u2019ll get you banned or suspended from Quora within a few days.<\/p>\n<p>The platform has active moderators that will collapse your answers at the slightest provocation. The spam policy (which you can find <a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/How-does-Quora-define-spam-What-are-the-consequences-of-spamming-on-Quora\/answer\/Quora-Official-Account\">here<\/a>) is vague and open to interpretation.<\/p>\n<p>It says many things but I\u2019ve copied the relevant part below:<\/p>\n<p><em>On Quora, spam is defined as one or more questions, answers, posts, comments, or messages whose purpose appears to be to direct traffic to external commercial sites while providing little to no value back to the Quora Community.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If a moderator believes you\u2019re sending traffic away from Quora and aren\u2019t delivering quality to the community then your answers will be collapsed. If you continue to do it then your account may be suspended or banned.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s OK to link to your company website or blog but it should be done in a way that delivers value to the readers. As long as you keep this in mind, Quora will become an essential <a href=\"https:\/\/www.venngage.com\/blog\/marketing-plan\/\">part of your marketing plan<\/a> and yield dividends for a long time to come.<\/p>\n<h2>Start with your Quora profile<\/h2>\n<p>Quora readers pay attention to the person answering a question. If you\u2019re a bank teller then they\u2019ll give your answers about the banking system weight. They won\u2019t spend much time on your answers about starting a business.<\/p>\n<p>There are two places where you let people know how you\u2019re qualified to answer specific questions.<\/p>\n<h3>Your Profile page<\/h3>\n<p>The Quora profile page is unique among social platforms. You\u2019re not limited to a short blurb. It gives you as much space as you need to share your message.<\/p>\n<p>Start by writing your byline. It\u2019s a short description of you and your qualifications. By default, it will show next to every question you answer so make sure it\u2019s a good one. The byline is now limited to 60 characters.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/your-quora-profile-page-look.jpg\" alt=\"your quora profile page look\" width=\"624\" height=\"414\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5343\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/your-quora-profile-page-look.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/your-quora-profile-page-look-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/your-quora-profile-page-look-600x398.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The rest of your Quora profile doesn\u2019t have such strict character limits. This is where you truly showcase who you are and why people should follow you. It also supports links to almost anywhere on the internet (you cannot put affiliate links).<\/p>\n<p>Later in this article, I\u2019ll show you how to direct a lot of traffic back here <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/increase-social-following-without-ads\/\">to increase your followers<\/a> so this aspect is essential. <strong>Don\u2019t rush into it. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Here are a few things to keep in mind when you\u2019re making it:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Add a large relevant image or video<\/strong> \u2013 Your profile picture is hard to notice but you can add a much better image or <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/video-content-for-social-media-see-what-the-experts-say-about-it\/\">even a video<\/a> within your description. It can be anything but try to use a graphic that represents your brand or a product you\u2019re promoting.<\/li>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Add-a-large-relevant-image-or-video.jpg\" alt=\"Add a large relevant image or video\" width=\"624\" height=\"387\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5345\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Add-a-large-relevant-image-or-video.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Add-a-large-relevant-image-or-video-300x186.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Add-a-large-relevant-image-or-video-600x372.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<li><strong>More about you as a person or brand<\/strong> \u2013 This is your opportunity to give more details about yourself to millions of Quora readers. If you\u2019re the CEO of XYZ company, say a bit more about it and your mission. Let them know why you\u2019re on Quora. Mention what they can expect from following and interacting with you.<\/li>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/More-about-you-as-a-person-or-brand.jpg\" alt=\"More about you as a person or brand\" width=\"587\" height=\"540\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5347\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/More-about-you-as-a-person-or-brand.jpg 587w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/More-about-you-as-a-person-or-brand-300x276.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px\" \/><\/p>\n<li><strong>Links to other digital properties<\/strong> \u2013 You\u2019re not on Quora for fun and games alone. Adding links to the right places is essential to make your Quora marketing strategy work. Add at least one link to a Quora specific landing page that gives away something valuable in exchange for an email so you can <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/6-email-marketing-best-practices-to-try-for-your-next-campaign\/\">use email marketing to<\/a> turn them into customers.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Also link to products, service pages, other social profiles, and more. Another method people have used to excel on Quora is treating this area as <a href=\"https:\/\/helpjuice.com\/blog\/knowledge-base\">a knowledge base<\/a> for answers they like or have gotten a lot of traction in the past. After you\u2019ve added links to every other place, add in links to your favorite answers or answers that shed light on your brand.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Links-to-other-digital-properties.jpg\" alt=\"Links to other digital properties\" width=\"624\" height=\"415\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5348\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Links-to-other-digital-properties.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Links-to-other-digital-properties-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Links-to-other-digital-properties-600x399.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Another section of your Quora profile should be optimized. This may not improve your conversions but it does make it easier for you to get discovered. On your profile page, look for an area called \u201cknows about\u201d to the right of the screen.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/quora-knows-about-section.jpg\" alt=\"quora knows about section\" width=\"624\" height=\"329\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5349\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/quora-knows-about-section.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/quora-knows-about-section-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/quora-knows-about-section-600x316.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It lists all the topics you have expertise in and you can add or remove topics. Click the pencil icon to add more topics. This increases your visibility and makes it easier for people to find you when looking for experts to invite to answer questions.<\/p>\n<h3>When answering individual questions<\/h3>\n<p>People have a diverse set of interests and experiences. Quora understands this and allows you to create a relevant byline for individual topics.<\/p>\n<p>This comes in handy because you may have optimized your profile as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kyleads.com\/blog\/podcast-hosting\/\">host of a podcast<\/a> about creativity but find yourself answering a question about pets. A byline that says \u201chost of the creativity show\u201d would be out of place.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re answering questions, there\u2019s an option right below your default byline or work experience that says \u201cedit credential.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/quora-edit-credential-box.jpg\" alt=\"quora edit credential box\" width=\"624\" height=\"413\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5351\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/quora-edit-credential-box.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/quora-edit-credential-box-300x199.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/quora-edit-credential-box-600x397.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Click it to open a screen and add specific credentials for the topics associated with the question. This is a great way to show specific expertise as the need arises.<\/p>\n<p>All of this is the preliminary work and it takes a bit of time to set up but when done right, you\u2019ll get more out of Quora. Now, you can focus on finding the right topics and questions.<\/p>\n<h2>Find the right topics &amp; questions<\/h2>\n<p>The topics and questions you focus on are among important things when trying to amass millions of views. If you spend your energy in the wrong place, you\u2019ll answer hundreds of questions with little to show for it. First you have to find the right topics.<\/p>\n<h3>Finding topics<\/h3>\n<p>Topics should be closely tied to your brand but have a large enough following to help you get views. This is essential because when you\u2019re just starting out, you won\u2019t have enough followers to generate traffic to your answers.<\/p>\n<p>There are three ways to do this:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Search Quora <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Use the search bar in the top right corner and type in one of your relevant keywords. Go broad at this point so you don\u2019t accidentally miss promising topics.<\/p>\n<p>A drop down will appear that shows some of the top matches but ignore those. Click search and it\u2019ll bring back questions related to fitness.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/using-quora-search.jpg\" alt=\"using quora search\" width=\"624\" height=\"400\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5352\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/using-quora-search.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/using-quora-search-300x192.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/using-quora-search-600x385.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Look to the left of the screen and click on the menu option labeled \u201ctopics.\u201d It\u2019ll show you all of the topics related to fitness as well as the number of followers it has. Open all of the relevant ones in a new tab.<\/p>\n<p>Repeat the process with other keywords until you feel you\u2019ve found everything possible through the search function.<\/p>\n<p>Now, it\u2019s time to revisit those topic pages you opened.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Use the topic recommendations<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>First, follow the topics so questions will show up in your feed. Each topic has a series of related topics on the right hand side of its landing page.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/use-the-quora-topic-recommendations.jpg\" alt=\"use the quora topic recommendations\" width=\"624\" height=\"368\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5354\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/use-the-quora-topic-recommendations.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/use-the-quora-topic-recommendations-300x177.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/use-the-quora-topic-recommendations-600x354.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Many of these topics get missed when using the search function because they have strange names or may be just outside of your niche.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if someone focused content marketing they\u2019d follow the digital marketing and social media marketing topics but may miss user generated content. The related content ideas would help them find it and expend their reach.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Follow top writers you find from topics<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Top writers got that way for a reason. Yes, they may be good writers but more likely, they focused on the right topics and the right questions.<\/p>\n<p>On the topic landing page, there\u2019s an area that says \u201cmost viewed writers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/quora-most-viewed-writers.png\" alt=\"quora most viewed writers\" width=\"624\" height=\"368\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5355\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/quora-most-viewed-writers.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/quora-most-viewed-writers-300x177.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/quora-most-viewed-writers-600x354.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Click on it and take note of how many views the top writers have, the topics they\u2019re following, and the questions they\u2019re answering.<\/p>\n<h3>Finding the perfect questions<\/h3>\n<p>Finding questions is a nuanced process because there\u2019s no way to search for questions with the highest follower count or views. That\u2019s why we focused on finding topics and top writers. They\u2019ll lead you to the right questions.<\/p>\n<p>Start with top writers. Go to their profile and look at the questions they\u2019re answering. If it\u2019s a question you\u2019re interested in answering, check how many upvotes and views they got.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/check-how-many-votes-a-quora-answer-got.jpg\" alt=\"check how many votes a quora answer got\" width=\"624\" height=\"430\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5356\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/check-how-many-votes-a-quora-answer-got.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/check-how-many-votes-a-quora-answer-got-300x207.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/check-how-many-votes-a-quora-answer-got-600x413.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Open all the questions that look promising in a separate tab. Continue this process until you\u2019ve gone through at least 50 of their answers. You can also sort it their feed by most viewed answers.<\/p>\n<p>Look at each question individually and evaluate it based on the following criteria:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Number of people following the question<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The number of followers is a proxy for interest. In most cases, the more people following an individual question the better. Every follower will get an email notification when there\u2019s a new answer.<\/p>\n<p>Aim for questions with at least 50 followers. That\u2019s just enough to get the ball rolling if they find your answer interesting.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/quora-finding-a-question-interesting.jpg\" alt=\"quora finding a question interesting\" width=\"624\" height=\"503\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5357\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/quora-finding-a-question-interesting.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/quora-finding-a-question-interesting-300x242.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/quora-finding-a-question-interesting-600x484.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The above example appears to be a good question but there\u2019s another factor to take into consideration, the number of answers.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Number of answers the question has<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The more answers a question has, the less relevant it becomes for your Quora market strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Why is that?<\/p>\n<p>People get an email notification when there\u2019s a new answer. Over time, they\u2019ll exposed to many unique angles and will be less likely to engage with new answers. In essence, it\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mobilemarketer.com\/ex\/mobilemarketer\/cms\/resources\/webinars\/17662.html\">message fatigue<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Even if a question has more than 50 followers, it\u2019s important to look at the number of answers to that question. If there are too many, then it may be better to skip it. A good ratio to aim for is 7:1. Seven followers for every answer.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/quora-number-of-followers-for-a-question.jpg\" alt=\"quora number of followers for a question\" width=\"624\" height=\"524\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5358\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/quora-number-of-followers-for-a-question.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/quora-number-of-followers-for-a-question-300x252.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/quora-number-of-followers-for-a-question-600x504.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Distribution of answer views <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The final criteria is the total number of answer views and how they\u2019re divided up between writers. For example, if a question has 100,000 views and one writer has 90,000 views, then they may have a large following or an interesting answer.<\/p>\n<p>If a question has 100,000 views and each answer has 5,000 \u2013 10,000 views then you can be fairly certain you\u2019ll get a similar amount of views.<\/p>\n<p>In the past, you could see total views to the right of the answer but that feature has been removed. Find total views by adding up individual answer views. If this is too much work, look at the top ten answers and see how many views they have combined and how those views are distributed.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve vetted a question, add it to your answer later collection and continue the process until you have a healthy number of questions shortlisted. You can repeat this process with topics instead of top writers.<\/p>\n<h2>How to answer questions for maximum views<\/h2>\n<p>Nothing matters if you don\u2019t create content people want to read. Mediocre answers don\u2019t get traction.<\/p>\n<p>When someone is scrolling through their feed, they only see a portion of your answer, 197 characters with spaces. It should be enticing enough for them to click and view the rest of the content. If it\u2019s not, they\u2019ll keep strolling.<\/p>\n<p>There are 2 specific ways to accomplish this on Quora and they borrow from timeless copywriting principles.<\/p>\n<h3>Curiosity gap<\/h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.enchantingmarketing.com\/curiosity-gap\/\">curiosity gap<\/a> is the distance between what you know and what you want to know or need to know. Clickbait headlines have made this an art form. The fact is, humans don\u2019t like loose ends which is evidenced by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodtherapy.org\/blog\/psychpedia\/zeigarnik-effect\">Zeigarnik effect.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re able to use a curiosity gap within the first few lines of your answer, people will keep reading to find the information you\u2019ve made them curious about.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/using-a-curiosity-gap-on-quora.png\" alt=\"using a curiosity gap on quora\" width=\"612\" height=\"195\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5359\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/using-a-curiosity-gap-on-quora.png 612w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/using-a-curiosity-gap-on-quora-300x96.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/using-a-curiosity-gap-on-quora-600x191.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In the above example, I threw out a few big numbers about popular startups.

Over 500,000 people viewed the answer.<\/p>\n<p>Use the curiosity gap by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Throwing out shocking statistics<\/li>\n<li>Focusing on a contrarian view<\/li>\n<li>Asking questions that you\u2019ll answer a bit later<\/li>\n<li>Tell them what you\u2019ll give them at a specific point in the answer (for example, I\u2019m going to share 7 ways to get in shape. 5 is the most powerful).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Storytelling<\/h3>\n<p>People connect with stories on a deeper level than facts and figures. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/03\/18\/opinion\/sunday\/the-neuroscience-of-your-brain-on-fiction.html?pagewanted=all\">Researchers in Spain<\/a> found that when we read fiction containing passages that involve our senses, the parts of the brain responsible for that sense was activated.<\/p>\n<p>On Quora, tell stories about your experiences that relate to the question. Keep the following things in mind when writing your stories and writing in general:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the rule of three<\/li>\n<li>Short paragraphs and sentences<\/li>\n<li>Get to the point quickly<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Quora answers should be detailed, carry relevant imagery, and focus on delivering value to the reader. If you get those right then you\u2019ll get views, upvotes, shares, and comments.<\/p>\n<h3>Other considerations<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/7-social-media-actionable-growth-hacks-start-getting-followers\/\">A quick hack<\/a> to improve question visibility is to increase the number of topics associated with it. You can add up to 5 relevant topics to every question.<\/p>\n<p>People who follow those topics may see your answers in their feed. When you\u2019re answering the question, click the edit icon and add in more relevant topics.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/more-relevant-topics-on-quora.jpg\" alt=\"more relevant topics on quora\" width=\"624\" height=\"480\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5361\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/more-relevant-topics-on-quora.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/more-relevant-topics-on-quora-300x231.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/more-relevant-topics-on-quora-600x462.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Not every question has editable topics but take advantage of this whenever you can.<\/p>\n<p>You can also update or create an answer wiki when there are multiple answers and it\u2019s difficult for people to sort through them. This option isn\u2019t available for every question but the more answers a question has, the greater the chance that it\u2019ll have the option for an answer wiki.<\/p>\n<p>To rapidly grow your followers, add two CTAs to the end of your answers. One will encourage people to follow you to Quora and the other directs people to a specific landing page on your website.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/add-2-ctas-at-the-end-of-your-reply-on-quora.png\" alt=\"add 2 ctas at the end of your reply on quora\" width=\"623\" height=\"312\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5362\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/add-2-ctas-at-the-end-of-your-reply-on-quora.png 623w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/add-2-ctas-at-the-end-of-your-reply-on-quora-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/add-2-ctas-at-the-end-of-your-reply-on-quora-600x300.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 623px) 100vw, 623px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is ideal because you\u2019ve answered the question thoroughly so you\u2019ll be safe from the overzealous moderators. If you notice any issues with this approach, remove the CTA that directs people to a third party website and instead, send them to your profile which has been optimized for conversions.<\/p>\n<p>Quora is a combination of quality and quantity. In the beginning, it\u2019ll be difficult to get a hundred thousand views on your answers. Make a commitment to answering multiple questions a day for the first few weeks at least. If you\u2019re having trouble with it, use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chanty.com\/blog\/best-productivity-apps\/\">a productivity tool<\/a> that\u2019ll help you focus on the goal. Eventually, each answer will get more traction.<\/p>\n<h2>Leveraging Quora activity to get into industry publications<\/h2>\n<p>The final aspect an effective Quora marketing strategy is leveraging your activity into larger appearances in industry publications. Websites like Forbes, Fatherly, Inc. etc. regularly syndicate content from Quora. You\u2019ll be able to increase brand awareness and get solid backlinks from the third part publisher (they leave most links intact).<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not easy to get the attention of the people in charge of publishing partnerships. One way to do it is find the people who\u2019re in charge of partner relations and answer the questions they ask.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/finding-partner-relations-on-quora.jpg\" alt=\"finding partner relations on quora\" width=\"624\" height=\"300\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5363\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/finding-partner-relations-on-quora.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/finding-partner-relations-on-quora-300x144.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/finding-partner-relations-on-quora-600x288.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can see that Alecia is in charge of partnering with publishers and has asked almost three thousand questions. Her questions tend to be asked in a way that helps publishers find the right answers. She\u2019s one of many people who do this for Quora. The best way I\u2019ve discovered to find them is following the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/topic\/Working-at-Quora\">Works at Quora topic<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Many Quora staff chime in when answering these questions and others will even upvote. Follow the breadcrumbs.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/follow-the-breadcrums-at-quora.jpg\" alt=\"follow the breadcrums at quora\" width=\"624\" height=\"449\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5364\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/follow-the-breadcrums-at-quora.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/follow-the-breadcrums-at-quora-300x216.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/follow-the-breadcrums-at-quora-600x432.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I found an intern, the CFO at Quora, and a business analytics manager. If I was actively looking for publishing opportunities, I\u2019d check the people who were following the CFO.<\/p>\n<p>This process helped me discover the CEO, a few marketing execs and even a question curator at Quora (whatever that means).<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/finding-a-question-curator-at-quora.png\" alt=\"finding a question curator at quora\" width=\"624\" height=\"474\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5365\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/finding-a-question-curator-at-quora.png 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/finding-a-question-curator-at-quora-300x228.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/finding-a-question-curator-at-quora-600x456.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Continue this process until you find a few people that work on partnerships. It can be tedious but it\u2019s worth it when you start landing those appearances in industry publications.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>A solid Quora marketing strategy can do wonders for your credibility, reach, and revenue.
