The fact is, many useful tools and features can help you boost your business growth on Instagram, so this marketing tactic is a useful one. You must increase your organic reach and get more engagement on your<br \/>\nInstagram post. The following tips can help you out.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>There\u2019s an ideal time to post<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Social networks work differently, and each of them has their ideal time for you to post your content. This has to be when your target audience is active or online. This will ensure that you can reach them better and <a href=\"https:\/\/buffer.com\/library\/increase-instagram-reach\/\">get engagement<\/a> from them. The ideal posting time also depends on your target audience and your service\/product. If you are reaching out to the working class, making posts in the morning will be ineffective.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Use Instagram ads <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>A successful social media strategy always has a blend of paid and organic traffic. An effective way to increase your Instagram reach is with Instagram ads. With your Instagram business account, you can easily promote your Instagram post to reach more people. This means that you have more thousands of people seeing that post, thereby giving the post, your brand, and product more visibility.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Experiment with videos <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>People generally believe that Instagram photos have more engagement than Instagram videos, which is true. However, it is not so straightforward. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newswhip.com\/2016\/10\/how-publishers-on-instagram-breakdown-their-photo-and-video-strategy\/\">A study<\/a> revealed that images get more attention overall (likes + comments) on Instagram, but that\u2019s because photos attract more likes. Instagram videos actually get twice the number of comments that photos get. Instagram users seem to be paying more attention to videos now, too, as the Instagram video watch time increases. So, it will help if you take advantage of this.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>User-generated content (UGC)<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Curating followers\u2019 posts for user-generated content is an effective way to boost your relationship with them and receive more engagement in your post. The users engage your user-generated content automatically and are more inclined to share. Also, when ranking content to be displayed on a user\u2019s newsfeed, the Instagram algorithm considers the kind of relationship between the user and a brand or other users. As they engage your post and share it, they tend to see more of it on their Instagram feed.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Host contests or ask questions to boost engagements<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Hosting contests or asking questions on Instagram is fun for everyone, but you are ultimately doing it to boost your engagement and not for its fun. Hosting a giveaway contest, for instance, isn\u2019t just fun; it boosts the number of <a href=\"https:\/\/later.com\/blog\/how-to-increase-instagram-engagement\/\">engagement on your Instagram posts<\/a> and also increasing your engagement with your followers. However, you should not overdo this even if you are getting more comments. Give some time in-between the contests.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><strong>Post fewer times <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Posting incessantly and continuously because you are trying to create engagement or increase traffic is a big mistake \u2013 one that many business brands on Instagram make. Instead of putting out 20 posts within a few days, you can take the time to focus on creating fewer, maybe 2 or 3 posts within a week. This way, you will ensure quality over quantity in your social media marketing, which is essential for your brand reputation. One high-quality post or two in a week is ideal, rather than making 20 mediocre posts. Also, posting too much content at the same time can reduce the number of attention that each one gets.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li><strong>Create Instagram-specific content <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Creativity is essential in content marketing. The different social media networks work differently. So, what works on Twitter might not work on Facebook, and what works on Facebook might not work on Instagram. So, when creating your <a href=\"https:\/\/neilpatel.com\/blog\/drive-sales-with-instagram\/\">Instagram content<\/a>, make it specific to Instagram. You can\u2019t expect the same results you get on twitter for the same content on Instagram. They work differently. Instagram is also a visual platform, while other platforms like Facebook and twitter text-based platforms. So, your Instagram post needs more attention and has to be different.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li><strong>Make the most of Instagram stories. <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Instagram stories are straightforward to find on Instagram. The fact that they are placed right above the feed makes them hard to ignore. There are now more users using and checking the Instagram stories of others. So, you can take advantage of this to get to your target audience. An advantage of Instagram stories is that it is not as crowded as the Instagram feeds are. So, they are likely to see your content when going through Instagram stories than they would when scrolling down their feed. Therefore, it becomes crucial to be creative with your Instagram stories, as it\u2019s an essential part of your Instagram marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li><strong>Do live videos <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Once you are live on Instagram, you will be right at the front of other feeds, increasing your visibility. It is even more effective if you are the only one that\u2019s live at that particular time. The \u201cLIVE\u201d logo over your Instagram profile will make it more prominent and visible to your followers. Being live on Instagram makes your brand more relatable as there\u2019s a human feel to it.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li><strong>Be consistent on the platform<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You can\u2019t <a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialmediaexaminer.com\/5-ways-to-increase-sales-with-instagram\/\">create engagement on Instagram<\/a> or drive traffic if all you do when you go to the platform is to post your content. You need to be active on the platform for you to be visible. Posting your content and ghosting on the forum until you are ready to post the next content will not get you engagement. Even if you are not posting at the time, remain active on the platform. Engage your followers, interact with other people in their posts. This increases your Instagram visibility and also helps you get more engagement on your own post.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The purpose of social media is for people to be happy. So, giving people a reason to engage you means that you are making them happy. If you use Instagram well, then the platform is useful for the growth of your brand.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the author <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Thomas Lanigan has work experience for four years as a marketing specialist, social media manager, writer, journalist, and editor at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bestdissertation.com\/services\/research-paper.html\">research paper writing service<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rushessay.com\/mba-essay-help.php\">MBA essay writing service<\/a>.
