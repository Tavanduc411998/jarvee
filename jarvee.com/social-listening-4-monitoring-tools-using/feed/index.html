I would like to recommend one more social media tool for monitoring - Snoopreport https://snoopreport.com. It tracks user actions on Instagram as likes, comments and follows so you can monitor customers and competitors to update the social media marketing campaign]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Adam!

Even I know how important is to monitor what people are saying about your brand, I just recently started to actually research this topic and learn. I&#039;m still a newbie, but hopefully will be able to get more valuable insights through the tools you recommended.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Adam,

Great article on the best social listening and monitoring tools. These tools are super amazing. I have used Google alerts. And as you mentioned, marketers are kind of over looking this tool, or in order words, they&#039;re undermining its potential. 

However, there other tools in this Cathay are equally remarkable. Some of these are:

Twitter Counter, Digimind, TweetReach, Sprout Social, Klout, Buzzlogix, etc 

Buzzlogix for example is amazingly interesting. But please, note that it has a free and premium version.

This tool will help you identify all the buzz about your products, making it easier for you to know what consumers are saying about your services. It also enables you to monitor your competitors as well as help you manage  your social media accounts. 

In fact, it has fascinating features that cannot be mentioned here.

Thanks for sharing this insightful article!]]></description>
