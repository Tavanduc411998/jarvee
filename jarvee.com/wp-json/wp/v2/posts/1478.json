Keep in mind that when you share something, you do it because it triggered something in you.<\/p>\n<h4>Have a great sense of Humor<\/h4>\n<p>Everyone loves a good laugh.\u00a0 Thus, show the comedic side of you by incorporating humor into your posts. Funny posts the most shareable content on almost all social media sites.

Being popular for something bad may not be ideal but it would definitely bring traffic and result to good interaction rate considering all the reactions you\u2019ll be stirring up.\u00a0 You can expect that hate comments will come pouring in.\u00a0 Therefore, unless you are prepared to deal with the forthcoming hostility, stick with being funny.<\/p>\n<h4>Be very creative with your visuals<\/h4>\n<p>Visual content is not just about crisp images.\u00a0 However, it should be good enough to catch the attention of the readers in a blink of an eye because most people would just quickly scroll down their feed. Hence, you only got a few seconds to make an impression.<\/p>\n<p>Try to focus on being ingenious with your images in the sense that it is expressive and witty at the same time.\u00a0 You can use memes or GIFs which you can <a href=\"https:\/\/memegenerator.net\/\">create<\/a> or download from sites that specialize in such images.<\/p>\n<h4>Start a contest<\/h4>\n<p>If you can afford to give away something of great value to your followers, don\u2019t just hand it over. Let your audience compete for it.\u00a0 This tactic would increase the engagement on your account and has the potential to attract new followers too.<\/p>\n<h4>Build up your credibility<\/h4>\n<p>All relationship regardless if it is personal or business is based on trust.\u00a0 You need to gain your audience\u2019s trust through your posts.\u00a0 Avoid being an advocate of fake news, research carefully on your sources.\u00a0 You should always be accountable for what you publish.\u00a0 When people feel that you are a reliable source, it would translate to higher odds of getting shared.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1523\" src=\"http:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/be-smart.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"558\" height=\"367\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/be-smart.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/be-smart-300x197.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/be-smart-768x505.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/be-smart-1024x674.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/be-smart-600x395.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Be smart when scheduling your posts<\/h4>\n<p>Last but definitely not the least, you need to know when your followers are online and most active.
