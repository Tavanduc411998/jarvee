					<description><![CDATA[I was not blocked yet but IG made me change the password. And they also said that I will be blocked if I give my password again to a service that helps me to grow in IG. I think it is beacause of too many actions :( Everything went normal till yesterday when I set Jarvee to like and comment Stories too.

So, my question is: can I come back to Jarvee and just started slowly like and comment? Or IG will notice when I will log in again in Jarvee? Do I have to change anything in the Jarvee settings? How long do I have to wait to come back to Jarvee?

Thanks :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We love automation and we will never quit using it. Why we love it, its because we want to make it all faster, we want to reach people faster, we want to make big money faster, everything literally. But sometimes we need to slow down a bit and make sure that we provide quality, not quantity. Thanks Jarvee guys for quality.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s pretty hard to use follow/unfollow strategy these days. I think that the new strategy is to use all the tools combined, at a slower pace of course. I don&#039;t want to forget Like Exchange tool as well, great tool. Keep with the great job guys!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Stop using instagram ! They have a action block bug. They show messages as that You use third party apps to get more likes what is not even true. Don&#039;t spend your time to Instagram with their crappy system. Blocked and than get unblocked and as soon as you post something you get blocked again and the time will get longer. Sorry but I have no time for instagram with their action block games. Instagram will be down by itself, just a matter of time]]></description>

We&#039;re aware Instagram marketers used to get followers with follow/unfollow method, but we have other tools too that can bring you followers. Story viewer is a hell of a tool if used correctly. Contact support so we can provide you some settings and tips on how to exploit story viewing in order to gain followers.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Instagram is driving me CRAZY! 3 days action block - account compromised - changing password - action blocked again!


I REALLY need your help guys,

as you read in the title, IG is playing this game with me for at least 2 months now and I couldn&#039;t find ANY help online and definitely not via IG help haha.
It&#039;s always the same: I get the &quot;your account got compromised - you gave a third party your password (which I didn&#039;t), please change your password&quot; -&#062; I change the password -&#062; I get action blocked for liking, commenting, following and unfollowing for exact 3 days for &quot;gaving away my password again for more likes (which I didn&#039;t AGAIN) and it starts again and again.
I&#039;m not using bots or anything like this, I have a double authorization, my Facebook profile is linked with IG, I used only android this time because somebody told me it could be my apple ID ect...NOTHING HELPED!

You guys are my absolutely last help for saving my Instagram account!]]></description>
