Others focus on the fountain of youth that is Instagram. And B2Bs, of course, wisely leverage LinkedIn\u2019s network of professionals for greater visibility. These are all good tactics, but if you want your business to have a truly <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.elevationb2b.com\/services\/b2b-social-media-marketing-services\">comprehensive social-media-marketing plan<\/a><\/u>, you\u2019ll add Twitter to your strategy. Consider these <u><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/twitter-statistics\/\">statistics<\/a><\/u> from Hootsuite:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Over 300 million people use Twitter every month<\/li>\n<li>80% of Twitter users are affluent millennials<\/li>\n<li>Daily Twitter users have been increasing steadily since 2016<\/li>\n<li>75% of B2B businesses market on Twitter<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Even more telling is that while Twitter is certainly popular in America (almost 25% of U.S. adults are on Twitter), it\u2019s truly a global platform. This is evidenced by the fact that 80% of Twitter\u2019s user base exist outside the United States. That means if you\u2019re a business looking to take your operation global, then Twitter needs to be a part of your social media strategy.<\/p>\n<p>The million-dollar question, then, is how best to leverage this platform for greater brand awareness and ROI. Like with any social media platform, there are best practices to follow in order to achieve this. With that in mind, here are the best Twitter optimization tips for 2019.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pre-plan<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re serious about developing an effective Twitter game and building your brand, then you can\u2019t wing it. You\u2019ll need to plan your strategy down to every last detail, including the subjects of your tweets as well as how often you intend to tweet. Experts recommend starting off at around <u><a href=\"https:\/\/coschedule.com\/blog\/how-often-to-post-on-social-media\/\">15 to 20 tweets per day<\/a><\/u>. Data also shows that the most retweets occur within an hour after tweeting, which is why a higher output is best.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll need to organize a schedule for your twitter activity, too. An invaluable tool to ensure you tweet consistently is a social media calendar. There are many templates, workflow solutions, and <u><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/social-media-calendar-tools\">calendar tools<\/a><\/u> out there that will help keep you achieve this and ensure you\u2019re laying out an effective plan of Twitter attack and following through.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Find the sweetest tweet times<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Say you\u2019ve crafted an enticing tweet and are ready to post. Problem is, you can\u2019t just throw it up on Twitter at any random time. If you want to maximize the chances your tweet reaches the widest possible audience then you\u2019re going to need to post during the times when that audience is most frequently on Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>Part of this comes down to predictable human behavior. Weekends are pointless, as this is when most folks are out with their families, with friends, traveling, or focusing on any number of things besides social media. That leaves us with weekdays, but even from Monday through Friday, there are hours when more folks are using Twitter than others.<\/p>\n<p>Before 9 am, for example, your target audience isn\u2019t even in the office. And after 5 pm they\u2019re either heading home or daydreaming about the near future when they are headed home, so that\u2019s out too. Lunchtime isn\u2019t ideal either because people are enjoying some precious weekday free time, which thus leaves either mid-morning or mid-afternoon.<\/p>\n<p>Hootsuite performed an analysis of nearly 60,000 tweets and determined that <u><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/best-time-to-post-on-facebook-twitter-instagram\/#twitter\">the best time to post<\/a><\/u> is Monday through Friday between 9 am and 4 pm, with the highest amount of likes and retweets occurring at around 3 pm. This is when many professionals are trying to get past that mid-afternoon slump and are taking quick breaks and\/or sneaking in some social media time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Build your twitter following<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/build-your-twitter-following.jpg\" alt=\"build your twitter following\" width=\"917\" height=\"449\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4246\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/build-your-twitter-following.jpg 917w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/build-your-twitter-following-300x147.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/build-your-twitter-following-768x376.jpg 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/build-your-twitter-following-600x294.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 917px) 100vw, 917px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are a number of strategies to achieve this, and one of the most effective is to optimize your content. By \u201coptimize\u201d we simply mean giving your target audience the compelling, easily digestible content they crave. So keep your tweets short (you don\u2019t need to use all 280 characters), share your best content, repurpose <u><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/content-curation-tools\">curated content<\/a><\/u>, include multi-media in your tweets (videos, infographics, GIFs, etc.), and work on your hashtag game.<\/p>\n<p>As to that last point, hashtags are a crucial part of reaching a wider audience and building a following, regardless if you\u2019re in the B2B or B2C sector. Some best practices include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a list of popular hashtags to use based on industry terminology and audience interest<\/li>\n<li>Aim for evergreen hashtags (i.e., #InstaGood, #Sustainable, #GreenTechnology, #ThrowBackThursday, #PhotoOfTheDay, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Base your hashtag around the benefit of your product or service to your customer (i.e, #BigSavings, #DataSecurity, #CloudSolution, #2for1 etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Use <u><a href=\"https:\/\/influencermarketinghub.com\/8-free-hashtag-tracking-tools\/\">hashtag analytics tools<\/a><\/u> to stay up to date on relevant and popular hashtags<\/li>\n<li>Keep refreshing your hashtags.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Also, engage with your Twitter follower and follow others in your particular industry. Follow the most visible Twitter users in your sector like influential bloggers, thought leaders, authors, speakers, business heads and anyone else who moves the needle on social media.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Focus on the right analytics<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No modern digital marketer achieves success without a solid analytics game, and social media is no exception. Just like with SEO and content marketing, there are signals you must analyze in order to glean what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t. Regarding Twitter, crucial signals include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Average tweet performance<\/li>\n<li>Tweet reach<\/li>\n<li>Twitter engagement<\/li>\n<li>Interactions<\/li>\n<li>Volume of social mentions<\/li>\n<li>Number of positive and negative mentions<\/li>\n<li>Following increases<\/li>\n<li>Social media reach<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>What these analytics are going to tell you (and they\u2019ll tell you down to a science), is your level of relevancy. Little to no engagement means little to know relevancy, which means your Twitter initiatives are going to be all for naught.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On a final note, regardless of your particular industry, don\u2019t be scared to show some personality and, dare we say it, humor. So with that in mind, we leave you with some examples of brands that keep their audience hooked with <u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/funny-brands-on-twitter\/259221\/\">reliably funny tweets<\/a><\/u>.
