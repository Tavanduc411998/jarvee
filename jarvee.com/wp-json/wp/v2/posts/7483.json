Projections estimate that the industry will still grow further in the coming years. Gaming enthusiasts, including developers, are having the moment of their lives and raking in profits while at it. Thus, it is understandable if you want a piece of this pie. If you have a new video-game, you\u2019d like to introduce into the market, or if there is an old version you are looking to revamp, there\u2019s no better time for that than now. However, there are a couple of challenges you may encounter. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/investing\/053115\/how-video-game-industry-changing.asp\">gaming industry<\/a> has become very competitive, with big sharks lurking, looking to swallow startups and small firms. Thus, you may be unable to survive past the idea stage without a rock-solid marketing strategy. Do not forget that regardless of how remarkable your game is, if you do not find a way to get it in the faces of as many people as possible, you will most likely fail.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some marketing ideas that will work for video games.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Streaming on Twitch<\/h2>\n<p>It is almost impossible to garner mainstream popularity in the gaming community without involving Twitch. Twitch is the social media app for gamers. This platform is used by gamers to take pictures or make videos of themselves playing games. This could be done either in real-time or just uploaded for subsequent viewers to watch. The more popular users gain a lot of subscribers.<\/p>\n<p>You need to buy into Twitch\u2019s popularity to increase the information in circulation about your video game.\u00a0 The good thing is, you can stream any video game on the platform. It is not niche-specific, so whatever type of video game you design, you can be sure to find an audience for it on Twitch. You can partner with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\">Twitch partner<\/a>, i.e., a gamer with a lot of followers. They could play your game and upload the video. This could be a great way to introduce your design into the market. Alternatively, you could create an account yourself. With any luck, you could get many viewers yourself, increasing your popularity and your video game\u2019s reach.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Blogging<\/h2>\n<p>This is a marketing strategy that is long-term, low-cost, and often very effective. You can create a blog on your website. There, you\u2019ll upload pertinent information about your game. You can also release regular updates and any other information that will be useful to a visitor. You could even decide to broaden your reach. Hence, you can blog about the industry in general, keeping your viewers up to date with current happenings.<\/p>\n<p>Your blog should be informative and creative. A visitor should be armed with useful information every time they leave your blog.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Mobile Gaming Ads<\/h2>\n<p>Advertising has always been a useful marketing tool, both for traditional and digital marketers. However, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.singlegrain.com\/blog-posts\/mobile\/11-companies-that-are-doing-mobile-advertising-right\/\">mobile ads<\/a> are considered a nuisance by most people. In fact, some individuals go the length of installing ads blockers just to prevent the pop-ups from disturbing their mobile use.\u00a0 Surprisingly, though, gamers are not in this category. It has been found that gamers pay attention to mobile ads much more than the average Joe. Thus, while mobile ads may not work for some persons, it most likely will pique a gamer\u2019s interest.<\/p>\n<p>While looking to run mobile ads, you have to pay attention to certain tips for enhanced effectiveness. For instance, you should learn the proper ways of placing ads to catch mobile users\u2019 attention. An ad may fail not because it wasn\u2019t interesting, but because of improper placement. Furthermore, you can look into making use of interactive ads. These invite users to carry out a specific action in exchange for a reward. Thus, for instance, you can ask users to click on the advert to use a demo\/free version of your game. Eventually, when the free version expires, the gamer may be incentivized to hop on a paid plan, having made use of the free version. It goes without saying that your video game should leave a lasting impression on a gamer. Certain aspects to pay attention to include the graphics, sound quality, etc. If the game is boring, the free offer will only strengthen a gamer\u2019s dislike for it.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/5-Best-Video-Game-Marketing-Strategies-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"423\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7485\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/5-Best-Video-Game-Marketing-Strategies-2.jpg 640w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/5-Best-Video-Game-Marketing-Strategies-2-300x198.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/5-Best-Video-Game-Marketing-Strategies-2-600x397.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>4. Influencer Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>Everyone makes use of influencers these days. This is tied to the fact that most folks &#8211; especially Gen Zers and Millennials, are on social media. <a href=\"https:\/\/influencermarketinghub.com\/what-is-an-influencer\/\">Social media influencers<\/a> are the \u201ckings\u201d of that space. When you receive the endorsement of any of such kings, you gain the automatic approval of their followers.<\/p>\n<p>You may want to reach out to any of such influencers to promote your video game. Of course, you will have to pay for their services. Some of them charge in the millions, so it might be a good idea to create a separate budget for it. The available funds you have will determine the influencer you go for. Thankfully, regardless of your budget, you can always find an influencer to work with. If you are lucky, you may have a friend or family member that is an influencer. They could promote your video games for free or at a subsidized rate.<\/p>\n<p>Try as much as possible to work with an influencer in your niche. Thus, look for influencers who are into gaming. This is because you can be sure that the bulk of their followers will be gaming enthusiasts too. It will be counterintuitive to promote your game to an audience that either has no use for it or is uninterested.<\/p>\n<h2>5. YouTube Marketing<\/h2>\n<p>If you are not making use of YouTube to market your video games, you are wrong. This platform is the second largest search engine in the world, right behind Google. You can amass a huge following simply by making use of YouTube.<\/p>\n<p>First, you can try running promo videos on the platform. Your video should be exciting, highlighting the best parts of your game. At the end, insert a call to action. You can do this by inputting links that direct viewers to your social media pages or to the App Store where they could download the game.<\/p>\n<h2>\u00a0Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>No doubt, this may seem too much, especially if you are new in the industry. Do not fret; the learning curve is not steep.\u00a0 You should be able to get the hang of it in a short while. Do not forget that the rewards you seek may not be instantaneous. Your video game most likely will not get 1000 downloads in the first week of release. However, if you keep at it, employing one or more of these strategies over a long time, you will begin to gain traction. The results you seek will come, as long as you are willing to be patient through it all.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the Author:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Since her teen years, Bethany Watson was always interested in writing and esports, so she decided to merge these two passions by choosing the career of a journalist who mostly writes about trends in eSports.
