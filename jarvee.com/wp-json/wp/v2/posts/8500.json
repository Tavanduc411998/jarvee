From Gen-Z to Baby Boomers, everyone has a presence online these days. Because of this very reason, business organizations have also started using social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, etc., to market their products and attract new customers. With the help of digital tools, companies are expanding their current market reach and enlarging their presence virtually rather than physically, just like most businesses do these days.<\/p>\n<p>The drastic change in social media becoming more than just a platform to share pictures and receive information has become rather advantageous for organizations. They are using this golden opportunity to sell their products virtually. Not only companies but people have also started to rely on social media to look for and buy products. In fact, statistics determine that almost 54% of users use social media to search for products. To help businesses sell better, AI has come to their aid. AI has gained a lot of popularity and has changed the face of technology. It has made its way through almost all aspects, including business and marketing. It can help companies expand their targets, know their customers on a better level, and understand their buying behavior.<\/p>\n<p>AI will give you the power to face your competitors, connect with your customers personally, and improve your sales.

The usage of AI to market products is becoming a trend these days. Using it to enhance audiences\u2019 purchases and provide customized products that catch their eye is undoubtedly a fruitful idea.<\/p>\n<p>Let us first understand the meaning of artificial intelligence.<\/p>\n<h2>What Is Artificial Intelligence<\/h2>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence, more popularly known as AI, can be termed as a digital aspect that has the ability to mimic and carry out human tasks without the use of an actual human being. It extensively uses machines and computers to imitate human brains to understand everything with the help of the data that is fed to them. It uses the information it collects to make predictions based on past data and improve your decision-making process.<\/p>\n<p>Because the use of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/konstantinebuhler\/2021\/03\/16\/the-rise-of-ai-systems-of-action\/?sh=2aa7e73e1000\">AI systems<\/a> and their tools are constantly increasing and are in demand, the field is continually changing and expanding itself to provide a better user experience. It has definitely changed the research and development game and has made it much faster than it ever was before.<\/p>\n<h2>How Is AI And Social Media Marketing Related<\/h2>\n<p>Back in the day when AI and social media weren\u2019t a thing, organizations used to market their products through traditional means like TV, radio, and newspaper ads. Now, technology has gained a lot of demand, and it has become a necessity for companies to adapt to digitalization and use it for marketing their goods and services. To help them with the same, AI came to their aid.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of businesses now have started to implement AI in their marketing strategy successfully. It follows every person\u2019s behavior on social media, the products they look at, their posting durations, the type of content they enjoy watching, etc. For example, if I follow the show The Office on Instagram, it will enhance my search bar with memes and posts related to The Office. So, companies that make merchandise related to it can display their products to the people who like the show and target them accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>Another example of the same is Instagram surveys. What they do is show us two sets of products and ask us to pick one. This goes on for 6-7 questions. They do this to enhance and personalize advertisements with the products that each user gets attracted to and would want to buy. Doing so might lead to one person purchasing from you and keep on coming back to you because of your personalized experience benefits. This is how <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-emergence-of-social-media-marketing-made-things-easier-for-marketer\/\">social media marketing<\/a> plays a massive role in helping you sell your products better.<\/p>\n<h2>How AI In Social Media Impacts Business\u2019 Growth<\/h2>\n<h3>Better Customer Engagement<\/h3>\n<p>With so much competition in the business industry these days, retaining your consumers has become more critical than ever.

Practical evaluation of your rivals will help you understand their strategies better, what works more efficiently for their customers, and also help you improve your process based on the same.<\/p>\n<p>As tough as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/231513\">customer data recording<\/a> is, looking for it and collecting it is equally complicated if performed manually. With the help of technology tools like AI, it becomes easier for you to do so since it gets rid of all the hindrances caused otherwise by humans, making it easier for you to access the information and upgrade your strategies to a more better level.<\/p>\n<h3>Chatbots<\/h3>\n<p>AI isn\u2019t just limited to collecting and recording information.

That is why you should develop content that is engaging and intriguing so that people would want to read through it. But, looking for new trends, making curated posts, etc., can be super tedious if done through humans.<\/p>\n<p>This, however, has become a no-brainer for businesses, thanks to AI.
