There is not a single person in the marketing sphere not caring about the word <strong>brand<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s not just a word on its own. You can find it as brand identity, brand image, branding, rebranding, brand personality, brand values etc.<\/p>\n<p>What is all that? And how can it be of use? And how to make your brand have all the charisma and uniqueness you need it?<\/p>\n<p>So, hold on, and first things first!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5798\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/How-To-Develop-A-Memorable-Brand-Identity-in-2020.png\" alt=\"How To Develop A Memorable Brand Identity in 2020\" width=\"784\" height=\"412\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/How-To-Develop-A-Memorable-Brand-Identity-in-2020.png 784w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/How-To-Develop-A-Memorable-Brand-Identity-in-2020-300x158.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/How-To-Develop-A-Memorable-Brand-Identity-in-2020-768x404.png 768w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/How-To-Develop-A-Memorable-Brand-Identity-in-2020-600x315.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>What is Brand Identity?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Brand identity <\/strong>is everything that defines your brand internally and externally. The internal part of your identity is the values, personality, concept and mission of your brand; the external part of your identity is the logo, color, writing style, tagline, catchphrase!<\/p>\n<p>These two parts of your brand identity should align with each other and supplement each other! Just like Ying-Yang!<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you are running an eco-friendly yoga club, then red wouldn\u2019t be the right color for your logo!<\/p>\n<p>If your brand identity is not consistent enough, then the brand image will be different from your brand identity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Brand image<\/strong> is how your customers, possible leads and acquaintances perceive your brand. This can impact your brand -directly or indirectly-, as it will decrease trust and customer loyalty!<\/p>\n<p>To make sure that your identity and image are a match you should create a proper <strong>brand strategy<\/strong>!<\/p>\n<p>You need to take the main principles of <a href=\"https:\/\/moosend.com\/blog\/personalized-marketing\/\">personalized marketing<\/a> and ensure that your brand identity is out there and everyone feels connected with it, as you are the solution to their problem!<\/p>\n<p>So, now that we understand the basic concepts of brand identity, we can start talking about creating a memorable brand identity!<\/p>\n<h2>Giving Birth To A Memorable Brand Identity<\/h2>\n<h3>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Define Your Goal<\/h3>\n<p>Every action we take has a goal. The same applies to branding our identity!<\/p>\n<p>The principal purpose of a brand identity is to create a strong, comprehensive set of identity elements.<\/p>\n<p>This set of elements cannot be created if our goal is not clear to us!<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of the size, reach and audience of our brand, the goal is the basis of brand awareness, consideration, customer acquisition and customer retention!<\/p>\n<h3>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analyze Your Competition<\/h3>\n<p>As your company is most likely competing in a market with other brands, it is crucial to recognize the competition and analyze it.<\/p>\n<p>You need to filter your real competition and see what they offer, what they stand for and the characteristics of their customers.<\/p>\n<p>If you run a local store with handmade jewelry, then your competition is not fast fashion stores, but other local stores selling jewelry.<\/p>\n<p>So you should focus on these local stores that already have a loyal customer basis, the way they operate and what your offer is!<\/p>\n<h3>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Find Your Uniqueness<\/h3>\n<p>Having a clear goal and then mapping out your competition will help you in finding what makes you different.<\/p>\n<p>This different approach on your market is your <strong>unique selling proposition<\/strong> (USP). Your USP should be clear in your brand identity, as it is the reason that customers will start considering you in the first place!<\/p>\n<p>Most of the time, brands follow the river of someone else! What does that mean?<\/p>\n<p>It means that they have in mind a success story of a specific brand, and try to follow the way that they made it!<\/p>\n<p>However, just ask yourself: what are the chances of preferring a replicate rather than the original?<\/p>\n<p>So, if you have decided the niche market you aim for, then go, be bold and find a way to create demand for your brand identity!<\/p>\n<p>A clear example of that is the Dollar Shave Club, which created the demand by getting out there! Another example is the unique undergarment brand, <a href=\"https:\/\/bamboounderwear.com\/\">Bamboo Underwear<\/a>, which positions itself as a line of fashionable underwear that feels like a hug.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5799\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/the-Dollar-Shave-Club.jpg\" alt=\"the Dollar Shave Club\" width=\"479\" height=\"270\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/the-Dollar-Shave-Club.jpg 479w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/the-Dollar-Shave-Club-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><center>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dollarshaveclub.com\/\">Source<\/a>)<\/center><\/p>\n<h3>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Create Brand Guidelines<\/h3>\n<p>You have your brand identity, you have analyzed the competition and found your USP. Then, you need to have some <strong>brand guidelines<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>The brand guidelines, aka brand identity guidelines, are used for any project, case, action that your company will have to go through!<\/p>\n<p>It is important to have clear, specific guidelines, limiting the scope and aspects of your brand. This will assist in making clear what you are up to!<\/p>\n<p>However, as circumstances change rapidly, keep in mind that you need to adapt and be agile to things you haven\u2019t imagined!<\/p>\n<p>Even in this case, your brand guidelines will be there to help you to overcome any difficulty!<\/p>\n<h3>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Visualize Your Brand<\/h3>\n<p>Most people start from this step! But it\u2019s a no! How can you create an authentic, original logo for your brand without knowing what you aim for?<\/p>\n<p>The logo of your company is not just an image; it\u2019s the main form of symbolic interaction with the audience!<\/p>\n<p>Be sure that your logo, colors, writing style, tagline are all on the same page and clarify what you stand for!<\/p>\n<h4><em>Pro Tip<\/em>: one of the most influential colors is blue; it\u2019s statistically one of the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.crowdspring.com\/blog\/brand-identity-small-business-colors-blue\/\"> most favorite colors<\/a>!<\/h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5800\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/one-of-the-most-influential-colors-is-blue.jpg\" alt=\"one of the most influential colors is blue\" width=\"508\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/one-of-the-most-influential-colors-is-blue.jpg 508w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/one-of-the-most-influential-colors-is-blue-300x135.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Raising A Memorable Brand Identity<\/h2>\n<h3>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Define Your Brand Organization<\/h3>\n<p>Following the traditional way of organizing, operating and recruiting will make it easy for your first steps.<\/p>\n<p>But that\u2019s all you&#8217;re gonna do!<\/p>\n<p>You need to think ahead and shape an organizational culture for your brand that you believe in. A culture based on your principles, values and personality!<\/p>\n<p>Create a bottom-top organization structure, which is formed on inclusion of lifestyles, backgrounds and points of view!<\/p>\n<p>Even if you feel discomfort or awkward, it means that you are stepping out of your comfort zone. And no one has ever been a thought-leader and ahead of his time feeling comfortable!<\/p>\n<h3>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Recruit Influencers, Not Just Employees<\/h3>\n<p>No, I don\u2019t mean you to recruit actual <strong>influencers <\/strong>of any kind! I mean that the kind of thought that sees employees just as people for a specific business task is long gone!<\/p>\n<p>As competition rapidly increases, and social proof is key for any conversion desired, your human resources are the best living proof of your<strong> brand personality<\/strong>!<\/p>\n<p>As younger people join the labour market, business will need to adapt to brand new conditions to be able to survive and thrive!<\/p>\n<p>Employees need to feel understood, accepted, supported and taken care of!<\/p>\n<p>No one wants to spend a third of his day in an unfriendly environment!<\/p>\n<p>So, your brand should be open, authentic and allow employees to co-create the future of the company!<\/p>\n<h3>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Create A Social Media Strategy<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5801\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Create-A-Social-Media-Strategy.jpg\" alt=\"Create A Social Media Strategy\" width=\"523\" height=\"262\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Create-A-Social-Media-Strategy.jpg 523w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Create-A-Social-Media-Strategy-300x150.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 523px) 100vw, 523px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I am not going to talk about creating a <strong>Facebook <\/strong>page, an <strong>Instagram <\/strong>business account or any other form of social media.<\/p>\n<p>It is up to you to decide which social media you want to use, which ones are related to your brand and where you want to place your bets!<\/p>\n<p>The best solution is to create an <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.g2.com\/omnichannel-marketing\">omnichannel marketing strategy<\/a>, which will bring the desired results!<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, make sure that all logos, descriptions, banners are consistent across different social media.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, prepare and create templates for specific kinds of announcements that you might make.<\/p>\n<p>Also, adapt your posts, announcements and content, based on the different audiences each social medium has!<\/p>\n<p>For example, <strong>Pinterest <\/strong>and<strong> Tik Tok<\/strong> do not share the same audience!<\/p>\n<h4>Pro Tip: Branding through social media can be highly impactful. Use a bit of emotional storytelling to make your brand more relatable to humans. Interact with people, through <a href=\"https:\/\/breadnbeyond.com\/youtube-marketing\/\">YouTube<\/a>, and live streaming showing them basic procedures in your brand (and don\u2019t forget to smile).<\/h4>\n<h3>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analyze Your Feedback<\/h3>\n<p>As your brand evolves and increases its reach and audience, more and more people are going to spread some words about you.<\/p>\n<p>There are people who will fall in love with your brand, people who will hate your brand and people who will neither hate nor love you!<\/p>\n<p>No matter where someone\u2019s opinion stands, you can always collect data and analyze them! Ask for some extra information, details and ask what could be provided differently.<\/p>\n<p>Take the negative reviews, think through them, and create a new user-generated <a href=\"https:\/\/launchspace.net\/blog\/business-development\/\">business development strategy<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h4>Pro Tip: If your company can support it, you can run an email marketing campaign to receive criticisms and review on what you provide! Make sure that you run an <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.mailtrap.io\/test-email-deliverability\/\">email deliverability<\/a> test first, because you wouldn\u2019t want your emails to be collectively considered spam!<\/h4>\n<h3>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Extend Brand And Evolve<\/h3>\n<p>You have created your memorable brand identity, you have raised it well and now it\u2019s time for you to take everything and extend your brand!<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind your unique position in your market, research on the ways your brand has interacted with your customers, and evolve!<\/p>\n<p>Why?<\/p>\n<p>Because if you don\u2019t, your memorable brand identity will be just history, and not making history!<\/p>\n<h4>Pro Tip: You have your brand guidelines, so make sure that you take them into consideration! <a href=\"https:\/\/venngage.com\/blog\/brand-colors\/\">Rebranding<\/a> can be very helpful, especially if you pro-act and not react to the latest trends!<\/h4>\n<h2>Being A Responsible Brand<\/h2>\n<p>Besides all the steps and tips given before, it is crucial to understand that societies evolve and change!<\/p>\n<p>2020 is another year that we have already seen tremendous changes and we will witness much more!<\/p>\n<p>Your brand needs to be responsible! Socially responsible! Yes, that\u2019s right! You need to follow corporate social responsibility!<\/p>\n<p>Based on a <a href=\"https:\/\/engageforgood.com\/unilever-consumer-study-shows-third-consumers-prefer-brands-social-environmental-good\/\">Unilever survey<\/a>, 33% of consumers buy only from brands that have a positive social impact and there is 1.2$ trillion opportunity for brands that make their sustainability goals clear!<\/p>\n<h2>Ready For Your Brand Identity?<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s sum it up!<\/p>\n<p>Think about your goal, find your competition, differentiate yourself, form your guidelines, and then give body and soul to your brand!<\/p>\n<p>Create your organizational structure, find the appropriate employees to make your influencers, conceptualize your social media strategy, take advantage of feedback, and evolve!<\/p>\n<p>To do all that, ensure that your brand is inclusive to all, respects diversity and promotes social causes!<\/p>\n<p>Then, people will be happy to engage with your brand, share their moments with you, and bring you your next customers!<\/p>\n<p>Tell me how that goes, your opinion and the outcomes!<\/p>\n<p>Or, maybe the news will tell me about your brand!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5802\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Let\u2019s-sum-it-up.jpg\" alt=\"Let\u2019s sum it up\" width=\"495\" height=\"280\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Let\u2019s-sum-it-up.jpg 495w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Let\u2019s-sum-it-up-300x170.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>About the author<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5803\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Christoforos-Zafeiris.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"112\" height=\"132\" \/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/czafeiris\/\">Christoforos Zafeiris<\/a> works as the SEO Copywriter for the email marketing software company <a href=\"http:\/\/www.moosend.com\">Moosend<\/a>.
