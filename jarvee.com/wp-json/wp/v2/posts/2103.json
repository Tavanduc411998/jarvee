As such, the appeal to use its traffic for your own good is high with everyone from people just starting social media marketing to seasoned marketers. Posting to Facebook groups is one of the main ways to get traffic to your site.<\/p>\n<p>And what&#8217;s the first thing that comes to your mind when you think Facebook traffic?<\/p>\n<p>You might be different or not, but I can tell you what most people think: Spam it like hell and some traffic will come.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately for them it&#8217;s not like this anymore. It hasn&#8217;t been for over a year. If you want to take advantage of what Facebook can offer, you will start to be smarter about what you do and how you go about doing it. It still works, but you need more finesse and less random spamming.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/facebook-marketing-how-to-post-to-multiple-facebook-groups-Copy.png\" alt=\"facebook marketing - how to post to multiple facebook groups - Copy\" width=\"726\" height=\"553\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2107\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/facebook-marketing-how-to-post-to-multiple-facebook-groups-Copy.png 726w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/facebook-marketing-how-to-post-to-multiple-facebook-groups-Copy-300x229.png 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/facebook-marketing-how-to-post-to-multiple-facebook-groups-Copy-600x457.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>OK, enough of an intro, let&#8217;s dig in and see how you can improve your Facebook marketing skills:<\/p>\n<h2>How to Successfully Post to Multiple Facebook Groups and Not Get Your Accounts Limited<\/h2>\n<p><strong>1.Do not post the same link in all the Facebook groups you&#8217;re posting to.<\/strong> This is a dead giveaway and it&#8217;s one of the most common mistakes people make when starting. Using <a href=\"http:\/\/bitly.com\/\">bitly<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/\">goo.gl<\/a> or similar services won&#8217;t help either. Facebook goes through most redirects and actually see what&#8217;s behind them. Either use several landing pages that through a form redirect to your main site or if you absolutely must different urls from your own site.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Do not post in too many Facebook groups with one account in one day.<\/strong> . Some time ago it was possible to post in hundreds of groups daily with just one account. Things changed a lot since then and now if you try that you&#8217;ll get your account limited from posting to groups for a period of time ranging from a week to a month. Start slow, join a couple of groups per day, post in 2-3 groups per day. Increase the number of groups you post to every 2-3 days until you reach a number that you&#8217;re comfortable with. Just to be sure I&#8217;d advise you not to exceed 50-60 group posts per day at most.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3.Your accounts age and activity patterns matters.<\/strong> . You might already know that the age of your Fb account matters, if it&#8217;s older you will get away with more than when you do when you create a fresh account. What most people don&#8217;t know is that the activity you did with the account also matters a lot. If you have a 10 years old accounts that you never used to post on Facebook groups and you start posting on 50 groups in day one you&#8217;ll get in trouble for sure. Whatever you do, you have to take it slow and grow over time, don&#8217;t jump into it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Leave no footprints when you post.<\/strong> This is not always 100% doable, but there is plenty you can do to minimize footprints:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>always use spin syntax for your text and make sure it\u2019s a high quality manual spin not some automatic spin that will give you away, people will still read your post and can report it if it looks like spam.<\/li>\n<li>If you\u2019re going to post to a lot of destinations (50+) do a spin of your link as well, instead of using just one link, make it a spin of 2-3 or even more links. As I said using an url shortener won\u2019t work. There are a couple of thing that you can do, you can create a couple of subdomains on your main domain for example, and post the same thing there or simply redirect them to the main page or iframe your main page in the subdomain page. Just make sure the actual urls that you post are varied.<\/li>\n<li>A couple of people tried paying for Facebook ads and it seems this helps too, so if you have some money to spend promoting a post on  your page from time to time seems to help in case you\u2019ve posted too much, they\u2019ll let you get back to it soon.<\/li>\n<li>Facebook looks at the images too so just make sure you vary your images as much as you can, Jarvee has an option that will change the images you post a little, the human eye won\u2019t see it but checks from facebook and other platforms should think the images are unique. You can do this on your own as well, even if you have the same image, edit it a little a couple of times and save it, make it smaller, bigger, cut off parts of it and so on, after that use all of those in a spin if you\u2019re hosting them somewhere.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>5. You should have your account do other things as well<\/strong>, not only post to groups as that\u2019s a dead giveaway. Set up 1-2 rss feeds from news sites or anything else you like and post on your wall, like other people\u2019s posts, make some friends. Make your account look as human as possible.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. If you&#8217;re using multiple accounts to promote the same url\/domain always avoid positing with 2 of them at the same time!<\/strong> This is very important as it&#8217;s a huge footprint for Facebook. Just set up your accounts to post at different times of the day and you&#8217;ll be fine.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7. Post less with one account, instead post with several accounts.<\/strong> Think of it like this \u2013 instead of trying to post to 400 Facebook groups with one account why not try to post to 40 groups with 10 accounts? This will spread the load and you won\u2019t have to worry about your one account being penalized.<\/p>\n<p><strong>8. Another tactic you can use is \u2013 post only clickable image links<\/strong>. This is especially good if you got your site banned on Facebook and cannot post that link anymore. Also it might even allow you to post links towards the same site at the same time. The settings should be done like this. Take 5 accounts for example, you should set 4-7 clickable image servers for each account and add those servers in Social Profiles \u2013 click on each account \u2013 \u201cShow advanced profile settings\u201d \u2013 clickable image servers.<\/p>\n<p>This way each account will use its own servers. Where to get that many servers? You can get a cheap domain for each account a .info should be around $1, create a couple subdomains on it and you have the 4-7 clickable image servers you need for an account as each subdomain is treated different by Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>You should also use a spin syntax for your images and host the same image in a couple different places. Someone suggested you could use an AWS S3 account which is free to host the images \u2013 haven\u2019t tried that so it\u2019s up to you to give it a try.<\/p>\n<p><strong>9. I know many of you are promoting your site but you might consider changing your tactic a little.<\/strong> Create a page for your site on Facebook. Promote that page on group using the share function. You can then funnel the traffic from that page to your site and you only have to post a link to Facebook towards your site, to your page that is, no more spamming hundreds of Facebook groups \u2013 at least not with your main link. You&#8217;ll just be posting\/sharing your Page\u2019s link instead, which should be a little safer to do as it\u2019s part of Facebook.<\/p>\n<p><strong>10. Use the bump feature more.<\/strong> This will basically breath new life into your posts and if you post the same thing over and over this will be especially helpful. In case you don\u2019t know how this works \u2013 it\u2019s actually quite simple. It will go to a post that you\u2019re already done, comment something on that post and then delete the comment immediately. This will bring that post back in first position in the group it\u2019s posted to, without leaving any trace as to why it\u2019s there. This way more people visiting that group will see your post and you don\u2019t have to re-post it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>11. Aim for quality rather than quantity.<\/strong> Instead of trying to post to 50-100 groups that are in your niche and you thing would work, try and be more selective, go to each group and see which one is active and where the members interact the most with what it&#8217;s share with them. You only have to do this once, and if  you know which groups are actually worth posting to you can concentrate on better posts on a lot fewer groups that bad posts on all the groups you can find.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Facebook is still very much at the top of the list for social media traffic and posting to Facebook groups is a very common tactic used by many. Be smart and take it easy, it can be done and it is still very profitable for people that know how to do it right. The above tips should help you get a head start but they are only the beginning, keep your eyes open and constantly test new things and variations. There&#8217;s no golden rule that works for everyone, each account and niche can behave differently and you might be surprised of how easy it can be when you get the hang of it.<\/p>\n<p>In you have any questions or want to share your experience about this don&#8217;t hesitate to comment below \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n<p>And if you have some more reading time and are interested in the subject you might want to also read : <a href=\"http:\/\/jarvee.com\/top-social-media-marketing-mistakes-to-avoid\/\">Top Social Media Marketing Mistakes You Should Avoid<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I am sure you&#8217;re already aware of this, Facebook is the number one social media platform in the world right now.
