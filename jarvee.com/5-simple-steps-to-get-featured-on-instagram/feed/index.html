					<description><![CDATA[Your number 3 suggestion is something that all influencers use which I noticed. They use this for multiple reasons, and it&#039;s a good strategy. They use it also to get noticed by some big brand and maybe even get some collaboration. Or they are already paid to do it post their products :)]]></description>
