However, it doesn\u2019t affect us only personally; it affects businesses as well.<\/p>\n<p>What customers are saying and doing on social media matters a lot, and even if it\u2019s not directly related to a brand, its products, or services, it carries a lot of importance.<\/p>\n<p>Social media can help you market your business, but it\u2019s also a valuable platform to learn important information about your customers.<\/p>\n<p>Every business today is on social media, and it\u2019s not only about being reflective and waiting for customers to contact you.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, you can be proactive and use social media to your advantage. Here is how monitoring social media trends can help your business.<\/p>\n<h3>It Can Help Build Brand Awareness <\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/It-Can-Help-Build-Brand-Awareness.jpg\" alt=\"It Can Help Build Brand Awareness \" width=\"612\" height=\"294\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6243\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/It-Can-Help-Build-Brand-Awareness.jpg 612w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/It-Can-Help-Build-Brand-Awareness-300x144.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/It-Can-Help-Build-Brand-Awareness-600x288.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Almost 3 billion people globally use social media actively. This is why social media platforms are an excellent place to target new customers. People are open to discovering new brands on social media.<\/p>\n<p>This is something that needs to be utilized. Current trends on social media can tell you what kind of brands are popular, what customers like about them, and how they interact.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s fairly simple in this case. When you see how your competitors are building their brand awareness successfully on social media, you can copy their behavior.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, different social media marketing strategies can inspire you to make a new story for your brand and engage potential customers more effectively.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if a certain style of videos is popular on social media, you can promote your brand through that similar style of video.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if some challenge is currently popular, have some influencers do the challenge while using your product.<\/p>\n<h3>Establishing Better Relationships With Customers <\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Establishing-Better-Relationships-With-Customers.jpg\" alt=\"Establishing Better Relationships With Customers \" width=\"624\" height=\"325\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6244\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Establishing-Better-Relationships-With-Customers.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Establishing-Better-Relationships-With-Customers-300x156.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Establishing-Better-Relationships-With-Customers-600x313.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Social media isn\u2019t only about promoting your products, services, or brand directly. Some of the best performing social media content involves entertaining and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lifelearn.com\/2019\/10\/22\/share-educational-content-on-social\/\">educational posts<\/a> that are related to your business and your niche.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to create content that will help people. For the best results, you need to find the middle between entertainment and information. This is how your posts will have the most value. People like interesting stories.<\/p>\n<p>Tracking social media mentions and analyzing the issues customers have with your competitors can give you answers on how to make these kinds of posts. Recognize painful topics, unfulfilled needs, and mistakes in dealing with customers.<\/p>\n<p>Then, focus on these things through your posts, comments, and conversations with customers. When someone is complaining about your business, make an effort to help them, and ensure that similar mistakes don\u2019t happen in the future.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, the customer is always right!<\/p>\n<h3>Utilizing Trends to Find New Leads<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Utilizing-Trends-to-Find-New-Leads.jpg\" alt=\"Utilizing Trends to Find New Leads\" width=\"624\" height=\"328\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6245\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Utilizing-Trends-to-Find-New-Leads.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Utilizing-Trends-to-Find-New-Leads-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Utilizing-Trends-to-Find-New-Leads-600x315.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When using social media monitoring with relevant keywords, you can easily spot emerging trends. You can notice blogs, videos, images, and other types of posts that all fit into the same category.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, you can also spot customers asking about potential services or products that are related to your business. When there is consistency in your search, this means that there is a gap that needs to close.<\/p>\n<p>If there is a market that could benefit from your products or services, this the time to be proactive. For example, social media quizzes periodically emerge as a trend and die out, only to return again.<\/p>\n<p>When you spot a trend like this emerging, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.proprofs.com\/quiz-school\/create-a-quiz\/\">create an online quiz<\/a> using a quiz builder and use it to gather valuable leads. These lead quizzes can be valuable tools for getting information about people you can engage in later and turn them into customers.<\/p>\n<h3>Dealing With Issues Before They Turn Into a Crisis <\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Dealing-With-Issues-Before-They-Turn-Into-a-Crisis.jpg\" alt=\"Dealing With Issues Before They Turn Into a Crisis \" width=\"624\" height=\"262\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6246\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Dealing-With-Issues-Before-They-Turn-Into-a-Crisis.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Dealing-With-Issues-Before-They-Turn-Into-a-Crisis-300x126.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Dealing-With-Issues-Before-They-Turn-Into-a-Crisis-600x252.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, social media monitoring allows you to follow what people are saying about your business and in what way. With social media discussions, it\u2019s important to be quick and react in a timely manner.<\/p>\n<p>No matter if someone is talking about you negatively or positively, you need to respond quickly. This includes all mentions, influencers, customers, bloggers, and other businesses.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Responding to Negative Mentions <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When someone is complaining about your service, and they decide to let out their frustrations on social media, you need to get over it instantly. A single unsatisfied customer can damage your reputation and make you look untrustworthy.<\/p>\n<p>Others are watching what people say about you. However, if you respond and offer solutions resulting in a positive outcome, this will show that you care about your customers and want to help them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Responding to Positive Mentions <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You might think that responding to positive mentions isn\u2019t as important, but it is. For every business, it\u2019s important to show that they value paying customers.<\/p>\n<p>Engaging in conversations with them is always a good thing. You will further strengthen your relationship with them and show others on social media that you are involved and active.<\/p>\n<h3>Trends Can Help You Recognize Your Weaknesses <\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Trends-Can-Help-You-Recognize-Your-Weaknesses.jpg\" alt=\"Trends Can Help You Recognize Your Weaknesses \" width=\"624\" height=\"468\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6247\" srcset=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Trends-Can-Help-You-Recognize-Your-Weaknesses.jpg 624w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Trends-Can-Help-You-Recognize-Your-Weaknesses-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Trends-Can-Help-You-Recognize-Your-Weaknesses-600x450.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Trends can give you valuable directions where your business should be heading. Spotting trends helps companies learn what is wrong with their service and avoid falling behind.<\/p>\n<p>This is especially true if you recognize major trends in your industry everyone is getting on board with. It\u2019s one thing to make your business unique, but there are certain \u201cstandards\u201d that need to be met.<\/p>\n<p>If your business is not compatible with upcoming or current trends, you need to align your social media presence and the way you operate. Luckily, social media monitoring allows you to keep track of important trend indicators like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Following important publications relevant to your business<\/li>\n<li>Seeing what the biggest influencers are doing<\/li>\n<li>Monitoring important performance reports from your competition<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For example, if you notice that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smartinsights.com\/digital-marketing-platforms\/video-marketing\/video-marketing-trends-2020\/\">everyone is using video<\/a> marketing, there is no point in fighting it. Instead, you should get on board with it and try to get the most out of the trend.<\/p>\n<h3>Summary<\/h3>\n<p>Remember that you need to be actively involved in social media to keep track of relevant trends. Of course, using social media monitoring tools is a good thing, but you need to be in it every day to get a better perspective.<\/p>\n<p>Social monitoring is not only about seeing what people are saying about your business. It can help you spot trends in your industry and around your business.<\/p>\n<p>Not only can you make the most out of your current efforts, but you can rely on these findings to make new business moves. Analysis of trends can improve your decision making and help you stay ahead of your competition.<\/p>\n<p>In the end, make sure to follow <a href=\"https:\/\/hootsuite.com\/research\/social-trends\">important social media trends<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the author<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Angela White is an ed-tech enthusiast with a passion for writing for the consumer market in the areas of product research and marketing using quizzes and surveys.
