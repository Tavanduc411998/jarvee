The tool is perhaps one of the most powerful additions to your SEO marketing arsenal, but with all its features comes a massive learning curve.<\/p>\n<p>To give you an idea of how to use Ahrefs, and how it helps thousands of marketers <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/seo-checklist\/\">create winning SEO campaigns<\/a>, we\u2019ve compiled a list of all its primary features. Some of the core features of Ahrefs are monitoring backlinks, gathering important SEO data on competitors, and comprehensive keyword research.<\/p>\n<p>Mastering all these features won\u2019t be easy, but it will give you and your marketing team the boost they need to dominate your industry.<\/p>\n<h2>Ahrefs Overview<\/h2>\n<p>Ahrefs is an industry leader for checking backlink authority. However, it\u2019s developed several other useful SEO marketing tools for users since its initial launch in 2011. Today, top marketers use Ahrefs to visualize several components of their campaigns, such as keyword research and competitor analysis.<\/p>\n<p>Since Ahrefs has the largest database of live links on the internet, they can offer one of the most comprehensive backlink checking services for digital marketers. The company has a similar site crawling program that can analyze a site using a web scraping API, similar to top search engines like Google.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/zenscrape.com\/\">Web scraping APIs <\/a>are useful in obtaining data for SEO marketers as it gives them all the insights they need to optimize and grow their campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, they can develop a report to inform companies on how to improve their site for search engines. Users can see a wide range of information on their dashboards, such as site errors, rankings, and top referral domains.<\/p>\n<h2>What Are the Top Ahrefs Tools?<\/h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the top Ahrefs tools for SEO marketers.<\/p>\n<h3>Backlink Checker<\/h3>\n<p>The backlink checker tool from Ahrefs is by far one of their most useful. With this tool, you can see which sites link to the competition. Companies can also compare in-house content and competitor content to find similar sites that link to both.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s very important that your links come from high-quality websites that are relevant and constantly updated with an existing following and a great track record. Ahrefs allows companies to check backlinks and whether they\u2019re authority links or not.<\/p>\n<h3>Keyword Explorer<\/h3>\n<p>Finding the right keywords is one of the most essential elements of an effective SEO marketing campaign. Keywords help search engines serve the right content to users, so having the right keywords can land a company on the first page of the results. Ahrefs has billions of keywords in their database, so companies never fall short of recommendations.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, Ahrefs includes useful insights about each keyword, such as difficulty and monthly traffic. Users can also organize keywords by country if they\u2019re trying to reach an international audience.<\/p>\n<h3>Content Explorer<\/h3>\n<p>Coming up with <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@HeathEvans\/content-is-king-essay-by-bill-gates-1996-df74552f80d9\">relevant and high-quality content<\/a> can be extremely challenging for companies looking to scale and SEO campaigns. However, it\u2019s one of the most vital processes to create more user engagement and higher rankings.<\/p>\n<p>Ahref has a database of content ideas that wrap around specific keywords and demographics. Companies can use this tool to give them ideas for better content to scale marketing efforts. Users can browse through thousands of articles around a certain topic to see what\u2019s working for others in a similar industry.<\/p>\n<h3>Site Audit<\/h3>\n<p>One of the most tricky things about running a successful content marketing strategy is knowing if something is working. With the Ahrefs site audit tool, companies can see if there are any holes in their campaign and make adjustments accordingly. This tool can essentially analyze an SEO campaign and spot out any errors, big or small.<\/p>\n<p>The site audit feature gives business owners peace of mind knowing that their SEO efforts are running smoothly. However, a successful campaign still requires constant monitoring.<\/p>\n<p>Marketers can create presentations about site errors and showcase them to the development team to make adjustments. Professional presentations of such information is important since they give the entire team a detailed view of how to operate the website. Visualizations like this can be the difference between you or a competitor ranking on the first page.<\/p>\n<h3>Content Gap Analysis<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/content-gap-1024x683.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"801\" height=\"534\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/marketinginsidergroup.com\/content-marketing\/how-to-perform-an-in-depth-content-gap-analysis\/\">Content gap analysis<\/a> is where a company takes all the keywords a competitor is ranking for to see which ones they\u2019re leaving out. With Ahrefs, users can add in a domain and instantly see what keywords the site ranks for. This feature is incredibly useful because it allows companies to find converting keywords to include in their content calendar.<\/p>\n<p>Not only does this work for titles and main topics, but users can use this tool to find subtopics within the content of their competitors for a more comprehensive content strategy. While Ahrefs isn\u2019t the only company to offer this tool, they are one of the only services in the market that allows users to go deep into subtopics when scraping for keywords.<\/p>\n<h2>Ahrefs Also Lets You Find Keywords With Lower Competition<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/ahrefs-1024x441.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"659\" height=\"284\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Many companies only look at search volume when trying to find keywords. However, there\u2019s a lot of potential in keywords with lower search volume. What\u2019s more, low-volume keywords tend to be less competitive, giving them several advantages for smaller businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Long-tail keywords can help a business that\u2019s just starting its SEO campaign capture thousands of visitors to their site. Add in a conversion rate optimization, and these visitors can turn into paying customers. As a result, these low competition keywords can bring in a lot of revenue, even with low search volume.<\/p>\n<p>Our clients require well-vetted prospects, and Ahrefs is extremely useful in helping us do this.<\/p>\n<h2>Companies Can Find Guest Blogging Opportunities Using Ahrefs<\/h2>\n<p>Finding <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.com\/ecommerce-answers\/what-is-guest-blogging\/\">guest posting opportunities<\/a> can be daunting for businesses looking to grow their content marketing strategy. Not only is there a huge grey area of where to find high-quality bloggers, but there\u2019s also the game of trust involved. With Ahrefs, you can access the profiles of thousands of high-quality guest posters and do outreach.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, companies can browse through several details of the guest poster&#8217;s profile to better understand whether they&#8217;re the right fit for the content. You can also check and see what other sites the author has written for by checking their Twitter profile directly on Ahrefs.<\/p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>No doubt, Ahrefs has numerous useful tools and features to help companies get off the ground running with their <a href=\"https:\/\/jarvee.com\/how-to-make-your-press-releases-and-blog-posts-more-relevant-for-seo\/\">SEO marketing strategies<\/a>.
